<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Film: A Very Short Introduction</h2><p>Film is arguably the dominant art form of the twentieth century. In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Michael Wood offers a wealth of insight into the nature of film, considering its role and impact on society as well as its future in the digital age. As Wood notes, film is many things, but it has become above all a means of telling stories through images and sounds. The stories are often quite false, frankly and beautifully fantastic, and they are sometimes insistently said to be true. Indeed, many condemn movies as an instrument of illusion, an emphatic way of seeing what is not there. And others celebrate the reverse: that film brings us closest to the world as it actually is. "Photography is truth," a character says in a film by Jean-Luc Godard. "And cinema is the truth twenty-four times per second." But they are stories in either case, and there are very few films, Wood observes, even in avant-garde art, that don't imply or quietly slip into narrative.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael Wood</strong> is Charles Barnwell Start Professor of English and Professor of Comparative Literature, Princeton University.<br>This is an excellent short guide that manages to cram in a vast amount of information into a very small space. It never pretends to offer a history of film but is a superb resource for getting students to think about film as a medium, and to think about what makes film distinct as a means of conveying information, emotion, ideas at the same time as generating wonder, admiration, controversy, or ire. An unrivalled introduction to thinking about film as a medium. / Matthew Woodcock, University of East Anglia</p><h2>Discovering Our Past: A History of the United States, Reading Essentials and Study Guide, Student Workbook (THE AMERICAN JOURNEY TO 1877)</h2><p>Reinforce critical concepts from the text and help students improve their reading-for-information skills with this essential resource, written 2-3 grade levels below the Student Edition</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Laboratory Investigations in Anatomy &amp; Physiology, Cat Version</h2><p><p> <b> </b> </p> <p> <b>This concise lab manual is designed for those wanting a briefer and less expensive lab manual than traditionally available for the two-semester anatomy &amp; physiology lab course and who also want their&nbsp;readers to develop critical thinking skills in the lab.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b> <i> <b>Laboratory Investigations in Anatomy &amp; Physiology, Cat Version, </b> </i>Second Edition </b>contains only 31 exercises, providing just the core exercises done in most lab courses, in contrast to the 40 or 50 lab exercises included in the leading anatomy &amp; physiology lab manuals.

Using a wealth of illustrations--with 74 in full color--to elucidate each concisely presented point, the revised and updated third edition continues to emphasize how design choices relate to the reasons for making a map and its intended purpose. All components of map making are covered: titles, labels, legends, visual hierarchy, font selection, how to turn phenomena into visual data, data organization, symbolization, and more. Innovative pedagogical features include a short graphic novella, good design/poor design map examples, end-of-chapter suggestions for further reading, and an annotated map examplar that runs throughout the book.<br><br> New to This Edition<br> *Expanded coverage of using mobile digital devices to collect data for maps, including discussions of location services and locational privacy.<br> *New and revised topics: how to do sketch maps, how map categories and symbols have changed over time, designing maps on desktop computers and mobile devices, human perception and color, and more.<br> *Separate, expanded chapter on map symbol abstraction.<br> *Additional case studies of compelling phenomena such as children's traffic fatalities based on race, the spread of tropical diseases, and the 2012 presidential election.<br> *Many additional color illustrations.</p><p>John Krygier, PhD, teaches in the Department of Geology and Geography at Ohio Wesleyan University, with teaching and research specializations in cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), and environmental and human geography. He has made lots of maps and published on map design, educational technology, cultural geography, multimedia in cartography, planning, the history of cartography, and participatory GIS.<br><br> Denis Wood, PhD, is an independent scholar living in Raleigh, North Carolina. He lectures widely and is the author of a dozen books and over 150 papers. From 1974 to 1996, he taught in the School of Design at North Carolina State University. In 1992, he curated the Power of Maps exhibition for the Cooper-Hewitt National Museum of Design (remounted at the Smithsonian in Washington, DC, in 1994), for which he wrote the book <i>The Power of Maps.</i> His other books include <i>Rethinking the Power of Maps</i>; <i>Making Maps, Third Edition</i> (coauthored with John Krygier); and <i>Weaponizing Maps</i> (coauthored with Joe Bryan)."I am thrilled to see this third edition. The new case studies and the added emphasis on data captured from mobile digital devices are so relevant to our contemporary discussions in cartography and in geography more generally. Ironically, many cartography textbooks are not well designed; this one is a welcome exception. The book is fresh, lively, and engaging--it is a pleasure to read and thought provoking for students."--Matthew W. Wilson, PhD, Department of Geography, University of Kentucky<br><br> "A superb book for covering all the important topics for an introductory cartography class, with excellent examples, humor, and a personable style. It does not read like a classic (boring) textbook, and I really appreciate that. The visual examples are excellent, as is the ongoing Voyager example that ties all of the concepts together in small pieces that are more digestible for students. The 'More' recommendations at the end of each chapter will greatly benefit students who get really interested in a given topic and want more information."--Melinda Shimizu, PhD, Department of Earth and Physical Science, Western Oregon University<br><br> "<i>Making Maps</i> situates the art, science, and technology of cartography in the human decisions that maps can help (or hinder). The book introduces the fundamentals of map design in a framework that emphasizes the editorial power cartographers have to shape how people understand place and space. With an engaging, easy-to-read format that eschews tradition, the book has a punk rock spirit that no other works in this field really match. The authors recognize the importance of contemporary mapping technologies without becoming burdened by them, ensuring this will be an essential cartography resource for a long time to come."--Anthony C. Robinson, PhD, President, North American Cartographic Information Society; Department of Geography, The Pennsylvania State University<br><br> "This book describes the intersection of maps and art. Graphically, the book is beautifully put together. The descriptions of data classification are among the best in any textbook. Readers will come away with a newfound appreciation for well-designed maps."--Monica Stephens, PhD, Department of Geography, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York<br><br> "I really like the style of the book. The use of lists as opposed to lengthy comparisons of different techniques works very well. The concise descriptions and commentary accompanying a wide variety of maps illustrate the authors&#x2019; points effectively."--Dean Sinclair, PhD, Geography Program, Northwestern State University, Louisiana&nbsp;<br><br>"The book is well written, utilizing language that can be easily understood by those with little or no experience in the art and science of cartography....Allows readers to quickly grasp the basic concepts of map-making and would serve as an excellent resource to anyone interested in map design or as a supplement to texts that utilize a more theoretical approach."

Kaniuk, Doody&#x2019;s Review Service, August, 2008)</p></p><h2>The Art of Active Dramaturgy: Transforming Critical Thought into Dramatic Action</h2><p>The Art of Dramaturgy is a transformative approach to dramaturgical thinking and collaboration. Each chapter includes ways to approach so-called old plays or set texts (think Shakespeare or Pinter or Parks) and then takes it up a notch to show how to use those skills when working on new plays.</p><p><p>In this valuable new book Brown builds upon the practice of existing professional dramaturgs across the United States by clarifying how a dramaturg can play an active role in the development and creation of a production for the stage. Brown&#x2019;s book demonstrates how at every phase of the production process the dramaturg can play a significant role in transforming &#x201c;heady ideas&#x201d; into stage language and action that the other collaborators&#x2014;directors, playwrights, actors, designers�&#x2014;can deploy in their creative explorations. <i>The Art of Active Dramaturgy </i>is a useful tool for those at a formative stage as a dramaturg learning a set of skills and for those unfamiliar with the complexity of the dramaturg&#x2019;s process and her potential impact on the artistic event being created.<br>&#x2014;Mark Bly, Senior Dramaturg, Alley Theatre</p><p><i>The Art of Active Dramaturgy </i>serves a truly useful function in introducing newcomers to the work of a dramaturg and offering ways for a student or anyone new to the practice a pathway towards tackling the role with confidence and a strong set of tools. But beyond that, it also takes what is often a murky and abstract set of tasks and outlines them with great clarity and through actionable steps, yet in a way that never simplifies or codifies the mysterious nature of art making. I will recommend this book to students but will also use it in my own practice&#x2014;in training young emerging dramaturgs who work in our department as interns, but also in refreshing and focusing my own approach to reading new plays and working with playwrights on advancing their work.<br>&#x2014;Tanya Palmer, &nbsp;Director of New Play Development, Goodman Theatre</p><p><b>Lenora Inez Brown</b> is the former Head of Dramaturgy and Dramatic Criticism at The Theatre School, DePaul University.

Mansfield, one of the world's foremost interpreters of this remarkable philosopher.<br> <br> Mansfield's aim is to discern Machiavelli's intention in writing the book: he argues that Machiavelli wanted to introduce new modes and orders in political philosophy in order to make himself the founder of modern politics. Mansfield maintains that Machiavelli deliberately concealed part of his intentions so that only the most perceptive reader could see beneath the surface of the text and understand the whole of his book. Previously out of print, Mansfield's penetrating study brings to light the hidden thoughts lurking in the details of the <i>Discourses on Livy</i> to inform and challenge its readers at every step along the way.</p></p><p>In the only full-length interpretive study of Machiavelli's <i>Discourses on Livy</i>, Harvey C.

These qualities are so highly regarded and embedded in both secular and religious societies that it seems almost heretical to suggest they can cause harm. Like most good things, however, altruism can be distorted or taken to an unhealthy extreme. <em>Pathological Altruism</em> presents a number of new, thought-provoking theses that explore a range of hurtful effects of altruism and empathy. <br><br>Pathologies of empathy, for example, may trigger depression as well as the burnout seen in healthcare professionals. The selflessness of patients with eating abnormalities forms an important aspect of those disorders. Hyperempathy - an excess of concern for what others think and how they feel - helps explain popular but poorly defined concepts such as codependency. In fact, pathological altruism, in the form of an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs, may underpin some personality disorders.<br><br>Pathologies of altruism and empathy not only underlie health issues, but also a disparate slew of humankind's most troubled features, including genocide, suicide bombing, self-righteous political partisanship, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid. <em>Pathological Altruism</em> is a groundbreaking new book - the first to explore the negative aspects of altruism and empathy, seemingly uniformly positive traits. The contributing authors provide a scientific, social, and cultural foundation for the subject of pathological altruism, creating a new field of inquiry. Each author's approach points to one disturbing truth: what we value so much, the altruistic "good" side of human nature, can also have a dark side that we ignore at our peril.<br></p><p><br>Barbara Oakley is an associate professor of engineering at Oakland University in Michigan.

When within-group altruism is exploited to between-group hostility, it can lead to suicide martyrdom and genocide." --Robert Plomin, MRC Research Professor and Deputy Director, Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London; author of Behavioral Genetics (now in its 5th edition), and past-president of the <em>Behavior Genetics Association</em> <br><p></p><br>"What most of us perceive as unmitigated evil, its perpetrators sometimes regard as self-sacrifice in the name of some delusional cause.

Johnson argues that struggles waged in response to institutional and social repression have created both moments and movements in which Blacks and Chicanos have unmasked power imbalances, sought recognition, and forged solidarities by embracing the strategies, cultures, and politics of each others' experiences. At the center of this study is the theory of spatial entitlement: the spatial strategies and vernaculars utilized by working class youth to resist the demarcations of race and class that emerged in the postwar era. In this important new book, Johnson reveals how racial alliances and antagonisms between Blacks and Chicanos in L.A. had spatial as well as racial dimensions.</p><p>&#x201c;Johnson's book illustrates how sonic affinities between black and brown provide a way of thinking about urban race relations that transcends the limited categories of conflict and cooperation.&#x201d; &#x2015;Daniel Widener, author of <i>Black Arts West: Culture and Struggle in Black Los Angeles, 1942-1992</i><br><br>&#x201c;From record stores to radio, from East L.A. punk to South Central hip hop, Johnson puts her ear to the post-WWII city and in a lucid, impassioned voice tells us what she hears: invaluable stories of struggle, conflict, and alliance that continue to shape the political stakes of the contemporary moment.&#x201d; &#x2015;Josh Kun, author of <i>Audiotopia: Music, Race, and America</i><br><br>"Gaye Theresa Johnson had to ignore all the noise about black-brown conflict, seek out archives that were never supposed to be found, and develop new ways of seeing and hearing.

Policy may be directed by ideology, but it must also be founded on reality. The challenge of making the right decisions as a public manager is often, therefore, based on the need for rigorous, actionable research.

Routledge is an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis, an informa company.</p><p>Donald Winnicott (1896-1971) was trained in paediatrics, a profession that he practiced to the end of his life, in particular at the Paddington Green Children&#39;s Hospital. He began analysis with James Strachey in 1923, became a member of the British Psycho-Analytical Society in 1935, and twice served as its President. He was also a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and of the British Psychological Society.The value of Winnicott&#39;s work has become more and more widely recognized not only among psycho-analysts but also psychologists, educators, social workers, and men and women in every branch of medicine; indeed, all whose work or practice involves the care of children in health or sickness.An important part of the value of these writings lies in the uniquely binocular view with which the author regards the subjects of his investigation. With him, pediatrics informs psycho-analysis; psycho-analysis illuminates pediatrics. This book is not concerned with innovation in basic psychoanalytic concepts or techniques, but with the formulation and testing-out of ideas whose origin was in the challenge of day-to-day clinical work that was the staple of Winnocott&#39;s medical experience throughout his professional life.This book is arranged in three sections. The first represents Winnicott&#39;s attitudes as a pediatrician prior to training in psycho-analysis, and demonstrates the degree to which a purely formal pediatric approach requires as an effective complement a deeper understanding of the emotional problems of child development. The second section demonstrates the impact of psycho-analytic concepts on pediatrics, while the third section contains his very own individual contribution to psychoanalytic theory and practice.</p><h2>Introduction to Probability Models</h2><p><p><i>Introduction to Probability Models, Twelfth Edition, </i> is the latest version of Sheldon Ross's classic bestseller.

It examines the ethical dimensions of these faiths, both individually and comparatively, by exploring how and what they think about a series of important issues such as friendship, marriage, homosexuality, lying, forgiveness and its limits, the death penalty, the environment, warfare, and the meaning of work, career, and vocation. In doing all of this, the book offers insight both into these particular traditions and into the common moral challenges confronting all people today. <p>The book pays serious attention not just to what each faith has to say about an issue, but also to how each faith explains and defends its moral viewpoints. Equal attention is given to each faith&#x2019;s deliberation and judgments on specific issues, the styles and modes of reasoning by which those judgments are reached, and the ways in which those judgments reveal some of these traditions&#x2019; deepest convictions about God, the cosmos, and humanity.</p> <p>Timely and insightful, <i>Understanding Religious Ethics</i> offers a powerful model of how the traditions can be understood and engaged charitably and critically &#x2013; the sort of understanding and engagement that will be increasingly necessary in the twenty-first century.</p><b>Charles Mathewes</b> is Associate Professor of Religious Ethics at the University of Virginia.

Christian Zlolniski&#x2019;s on-the-ground investigation demonstrates how global forces have incorporated these workers as an integral part of the economy through subcontracting and other flexible labor practices and explores how these labor practices have in turn affected working conditions and workers&#x2019; daily lives. In Zlolniski&#x2019;s analysis, these immigrants do not emerge merely as victims of a harsh economy; despite the obstacles they face, they are transforming labor and community politics, infusing new blood into labor unions, and challenging exclusionary notions of civic and political membership. This richly textured and complex portrait of one community opens a window onto the future of Mexican and other Latino immigrants in the new U.S. economy.</p><p>"In a time when we have great need to understand Mexican immigrants and their place in U.S. society, Zlolniski offers a superior analysis of why and how advanced capitalist economies employ undocumented workers. After reading his book, we will never think again of immigration as something that exclusively comes from outside. The immigrants, too, have agency in his account, as he narrates and analyzes an important case of unionization, pointing to significant new possibilities in American life."&#x2015;Josiah Heyman, Professor of Anthropology, University of Texas at El Paso<br><br>"Zlolniski makes a critical contribution to our understanding of the underside of advanced capitalism. He shows us its complexities: It is not only about misery, it is also about shaping subjective and political possibilities. If there is one concept that comes to mind it is the complexity of powerlessness."&#x2015;Saskia Sassen, author of <i>Guests and Aliens</i><br><br>"This is a well-written and accessible ethnography of Mexican immigrants in Silicon Valley, the working poor who live in the shadow of affluence. Zlolniski presents a nuanced analysis of the thin line between formal and informal work, how families strategize and cope with the myriad challenges wrought by poverty, and the structural limitations to human agency. Zlolniski's perceptive ethnography illuminates hidden social worlds and struggles for dignity through collective action."&#x2015;Patricia Zavella, author of <i>Women's Work and Chicano Families: Cannery Workers of the Santa Clara Valley</i><br><br>"Stringing together multiple livelihoods, moving among wage labor, the informal economy, and political activism, the immigrants Zlolniski profiles refuse to submit completely to the structural cards stacked against them. In this important and carefully situated study, Zlolniski engages internationally relevant debates over the changing nature of work, the abandonment of employer liability, and the propensity for the media to construct myths that simplify and underestimate the hard work of immigrant families in Silicon Valley."&#x2015;David Griffith, author of <i>Fishers at Work, Workers at Sea: a Puerto Rican Journey through Labor and Refuge</i><b>Christian Zlolniski</b> is Assistant Professor in Anthropology and in the Center for Mexican American Studies at the University of Texas at Arlington.</p><h2>A New Approach to Keyboard Harmony</h2><p><p><strong>This practical collection is designed to accommodate the needs of students with widely differing levels of keyboard ability.</strong></p> Developed over many years of classroom experience by members of the music faculty at Queens College, it offers a substantial body of graded keyboard exercises organized by specific skills.

The cavern&#x2019;s darkness enveloped her, as did the chill air. It smelled clean here, unsullied, a place that might have remained hidden throughout all the history of the Kings of Sharakhai, perhaps longer. <br> &nbsp;<br> In her hands she held a thick, golden bracelet. She turned it over, again and again, feeling its weight, touching the oval stone, roughing her skin against the intricate designs worked into the gold. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Speak to me,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;This time, speak to me.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The echoes went on and on. <br> &nbsp;<br> The bracelet had once belonged to King Mesut, the Jackal King, but now it served as an indictment of all the Kings and even of the gods them�selves. It was not the band itself that provided evidence of their treachery, but the onyx stone. Even now she could feel the souls of the seventeen dead asirim within it, clamoring for freedom, pleading for their release. �eda was desperate to give it to them, but after six weeks of trying she still had no idea <i>how</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> On the night of the great battle in King&#x2019;s Harbor, Mesut had summoned them forth as wights and set them against �eda and Sehid-Alaz, the King of the thirteenth tribe, the crowned asir who had kissed her and set her on this strange new path. It had been a desperate moment, but she&#x2019;d managed to sever Mesut&#x2019;s hand and take the golden band from him. She&#x2019;d pleaded with the ghostly souls to take their revenge against Mesut, and they&#x2019;d answered, descending on Mesut like buzzards. Each rake of their terrible claws had brought them exultation, a taste of their long-awaited revenge, but the joy had been short-lived. No sooner had Mesut succumbed to his wounds than they&#x2019;d been drawn back into their prison and chained once more. The trick to freeing them had eluded her ever since. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;By your grace,&#x201d; �eda whispered to the goddess, Nalamae. <br> &nbsp;<br> Cleaving open her mother&#x2019;s flame-shaped locket, she took out the last of her adichara petals. Her mouth watered at the floral scent, and when she placed it beneath her tongue, the mineral taste rushed through her. It warmed her limbs, drove away the cold humidity of the cavern in a way that a fire never could. Clipping the locket closed, she breathed deeply, closed her eyes, and welcomed the sensations that came. <br> &nbsp;<br> She felt the asir, Kerim, somewhere high above her. He was outside the cavern, roaming among the rocks, she guessed. He seemed reticent, as if he were hiding his thoughts and emotions from her. He didn&#x2019;t like the bracelet. He&#x2019;d told her so. She could feel the revulsion within him, though whether it was from the constant reminder of his own fate, or concern for the souls trapped within, she couldn&#x2019;t say. <br> &nbsp;<br> Opening her mind further, she beckoned the souls nearer. When they retreated, she searched for the onyx&#x2019;s boundaries, tried to define them in some way so that she might learn more about the souls within. But as it had every other time she&#x2019;d done this, the gemstone felt unknowable&#x2014; a star in the sky, well beyond the ken of mortal man. When she&#x2019;d taken petals in the past, in or near Sharakhai, she could always sense the blooming fields and the asirim below, trapped in their sandy graves. Even now she could feel them, far, far to the west of the cavern where she and Kerim now hid. She&#x2019;d thought by using the petals she would feel the asirim in the onyx. She&#x2019;d hoped to be able to puzzle out its secrets, to use the asirim&#x2019;s shared bond to free them from their prison or, failing that, simply <i>speak </i>with them as she did with Kerim. To no avail. She&#x2019;d been rebuffed over and over again. Not once in the weeks following the great battle in King&#x2019;s Harbor had she felt nearer to her goal. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Speak,&#x201d; she said, that lone word echoing in the cave. &#x201c;But one word, and I&#x2019;ll know this is not a lost cause.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Her only reply was a miasma of anguish, fear, confusion, and hatred. The same as always. <br> &nbsp;<br> Her concentration was broken, as it was so often of late, by the growls and yapping of wolves. She was tempted to simply let it go on, but when the sound became more fierce, and she felt panic emanating from Kerim, she pulled away from the souls in the bracelet. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Forgive me,&#x201d; she whispered, and rushed up the winding tunnel toward the sun. <br> &nbsp;<br> She was out of breath by the time she reached the cavern&#x2019;s entrance where, spread before her in a protective fan, were her pack of maned wolves. They&#x2019;d placed themselves between Kerim and the entrance to �eda&#x2019;s cave. Directly before Kerim&#x2019;s crouched form was Mist, a white wolf, hunkered low, ears laid back, teeth bared as a deep growl issued from her throat. She was the very wolf �eda had stumbled across with Emre on her first trip to the blooming fields, the very wolf that had healed �eda and led her here so she could re�cover from her wounds and decide what to do next <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Kerim!&#x201d; �eda said as she approached. <br> &nbsp;<br> Kerim didn&#x2019;t acknowledge her. He was staring at Mist, his jaundiced eyes wild and nervous, as if he couldn&#x2019;t understand how he&#x2019;d come to be here. His disorientation had been getting worse the longer they hid from the Kings&#x2019; forces. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Kerim, back away. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> As she came near, the maned wolves closed ranks, blocking her path. The largest among them, the scarred one she&#x2019;d named Thorn, was padding behind Kerim. Though the pack tried to stop her, �eda pushed her way through them, then charged at Thorn, waving her arms as the wolf darted toward Kerim, silent, teeth bared. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thorn, no!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Kerim turned, arms raised, just in time for Thorn to claw him, to tear at his shriveled, blackened skin. Kerim could have killed him with one blow&#x2014; the asirim were inhumanly strong&#x2014; but he didn&#x2019;t. He backed away, warding off Thorn&#x2019;s advances with arms and hands spread wide. But the danger was far from over. While she&#x2019;d been focused on Thorn, Mist had pad�ded to �eda&#x2019;s left, clearing a path to Kerim. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Back!&#x201d; �eda cried, putting herself between Kerim and the white wolf. <br> &nbsp;<br> Mist&#x2019;s eyes flicked between Kerim and �eda, but she obeyed, and �eda ran to stop Thorn. <br> &nbsp;<br> Kerim wailed, his bloodshot eyes wild with fear. He swung wildly, an�grily, at Thorn. �eda heard a thud as Kerim&#x2019;s fist struck the wolf&#x2019;s massive head. Thorn was the largest among the wolves&#x2014; with his long legs, his head was higher than �eda&#x2019;s&#x2014; yet he was flung aside by the force of that blow. It brought on a fierce yelp and a renewed fury that drove the entire pack to close in. Their heads were low, growls rumbling from between their bared teeth. They&#x2019;d listened to �eda until now, but with Kerim&#x2019;s attack on their leader, they were ready to excise this hated member from their pack once and for all. <br> &nbsp;<br> �eda pulled at Thorn&#x2019;s black mane. &#x201c;Leave him alone!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> But Thorn rounded on her and charged. Jaws snapping, he caught her wrist. She managed to snatch her hand away, but caught several deep gashes while doing so. She stumbled backward and fell as Thorn advanced, snapping at her ankles as she tried to kick him. He&#x2019;d just managed to clamp his jaw over her calf when a blur of ivory flew in. <br> &nbsp;<br> Her leg was freed as Mist and Thorn growled, grappled, and rolled in the sand. The other wolves looked on, their eyes intense as they studied the two wolves locked in battle. It grew so fierce �eda thought they would kill each other, but when Kerim turned and began sprinting over the sand away from them, the wolves finally disengaged. <br> &nbsp;<br> In moments, all their growling and yipping and yowling stopped. They panted, wary but content in Kerim&#x2019;s absence. Thorn was the most animated among them, alternating looks between �eda and Mist, but then he loped off, heading into the shade of the rocky overhang near the cave entrance, where he dropped down and watched, as if daring any to come near and challenge him, �eda included. <br> &nbsp;<br> Mist padded closer to �eda and licked the blood welling from her wounds. They immediately felt better, just as her injuries had weeks ago. Mist did the same to the puncture wounds along �eda&#x2019;s calf while �eda raked her fingers through Mist&#x2019;s cloudy mane. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said, then limped after Kerim. <br> &nbsp;<br> She followed the footsteps and the trail of black blood left over the sand, weaving her way between the sentinel-like pillars of rock. She found him a quarter-league away, sitting cross-legged between the dunes, knees hugged to his chest like a child lost in the desert. <br> &nbsp;<br> She crouched by his side, careful not to touch him but close enough that he could feel her warmth. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to stay.&#x201d; She waved her arm to the dunes. &#x201c;You can go, flee into the desert. Surely, somewhere in the Great Mother you might find peace.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> She didn&#x2019;t want Kerim to go. Not truly. She wanted to free him or, failing that, find a way for him to have his revenge on the Kings, and how could she do either of those things if he left? But his misery was so great she had to try. <br> &nbsp;<br> His only response was to swivel his head and stare at her left wrist, where Mesut&#x2019;s thick gold band rested. �eda felt the souls in the onyx gemstone, though muted, as they always were in the sunlight. As if he couldn&#x2019;t bear to think about them any longer, Kerim lifted his gaze to meet hers, a silent plea, and then looked to the sword at her side. Her ebon blade. She put her hand on the pommel, knowing that he&#x2019;d contemplated this, his final release, since leaving Sharakhai. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I will give it to you, if that&#x2019;s what you wish.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Kerim opened his mouth to speak. A long wheeze came out. He swal�lowed and tried again. <i>&#x201c;I . . .&#x201d; </i>he said, the lone word coming out in one long rasp. <i>&#x201c;I would . . .&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> She stood and with clear intent laid her hand over the leather grip of River&#x2019;s Daughter. &#x201c;This?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> He nodded. <br> &nbsp;<br> �eda&#x2019;s heart pounded loud in her ears. She didn&#x2019;t wish to be alone out here, nor did she wish to end a life that might help others to win their free�dom, but she meant what she&#x2019;d said. No one deserved a life like Kerim&#x2019;s. <br> &nbsp;<br> And yet . . . <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You must say it, Kerim.&#x201d; She licked her lips, praying he would say no. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do it unless you say it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Kerim stood, the blackened skin of his forehead wrinkling. <i>&#x201c;I . . .&#x201d; </i>he said again, but then he turned sharply to his left, and �eda followed his gaze. <br> &nbsp;<br> Beyond a dozen clutches of standing stones, she saw it, a sleek ship, lateen sails cutting a line across the horizon&#x2014; a royal yacht, from the looks of it. It was not headed directly toward them, but a crewman atop the vulture&#x2019;s nest might see them at any moment. <br> &nbsp;<br> She crouched, pulling Kerim down with her. Her fingers became sticky with the dark, drying blood on his arm. <br> &nbsp;<br> He looked at the blood, lifted his gaze to the ship in the distance, then regarded �eda once more. <i>&#x201c;I cannot leave you.&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> She was tempted to ask if he was certain, only her relief was so great she couldn&#x2019;t find the words. &#x201c;Come,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;We shouldn&#x2019;t linger.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> As they headed low and fast toward the cave where the pack had gathered in the shade, she felt Kerim&#x2019;s worry growing. He&#x2019;d managed to resist the Kings&#x2019; call thus far, but could he if a Maiden were close and summoned him, or worse, a King? Ahead, Mist was digging in the sand, most likely for a lizard to eat, or to give to �eda, but stopped when �eda came near. Her ears perked and her head lifted. Perhaps sensing worry in �eda even as �eda felt it in Kerim, Mist returned to the shade of the rocks and lay beside them. <br> &nbsp;<br> A pack once more, they huddled close, while in the distance the yacht drifted across the horizon. It adjusted course once, and �eda thought they&#x2019;d been spotted but, thank the gods, it merely continued in a straight line. <br> &nbsp;<br> When the sails were nearly lost, �eda breathed easier, but Mist was still tense. She gave a soft yip, staring at the rocks above them, then huffed and nipped at �eda&#x2019;s wrist. Wary, �eda stood and, silent as a scarab, climbed the rocks, gained their flattened top, and crawled to the far lip. <br> &nbsp;<br> On the sand below, a hundred paces distant, three skiffs huddled behind a cluster of stones. Three women and a man with a long, sandy beard stood nearby. They watched the horizon, where the tips of the yacht&#x2019;s masts could still be seen, wavering in the heat. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Four to man three skiffs? </i>�eda thought. <i>There must be more crew. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> The typical minimum was two to a skiff, but given how much gear she saw inside the hulls, likely a dozen had come. The footprints she saw heading away from the ships confirmed her fears. <br> &nbsp;<br> She&#x2019;d grown out of practice with feeling for the hearts of those around her. She tried now, clumsily, and realized too late there were others nearby, some working their way around the bulk of the rock she lay upon&#x2014; <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Stand,&#x201d; came a voice behind her. &#x201c;Slowly.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> She stood and turned to find a woman and a man only a few paces away, both holding shamshirs. �eda lifted her hands in peace as the stiff wind tugged at their amber thawbs. Their faces were hidden by the veils of their turbans, but �eda recognized contempt when she saw it. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your sword,&#x201d; the woman said. &#x201c;Carefully.&#x201d; She wore a black turban with thread-of-gold embroidered throughout. The small coins adorning the fringes clinked softly in the wind. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am not yours to command,&#x201d; �eda said, lowering her hands until they were loose at her sides. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fool girl,&#x201d; the man said, stepping forward, ready to poke her chest with the tip of his shamshir&#x2014; a warning meant to draw a bit of blood if �eda re�fused to comply. He did it sloppily, betting she&#x2019;d be cowed, but in this he was sadly mistaken. Before his blade could touch her she spun and slid alongside the path of his swing. He tried to recover, but she was inside his guard now and moving quickly. As he pulled his shamshir back, she gripped the blade near the hilt with one hand, his wrist with the other, and followed his movement. She guided the sword back and up, twisting beneath it and controlling him so that his body effectively blocked any advance by his female companion. <br> &nbsp;<br> She had more than enough leverage to snap his wrist or dislocate his arm, but she merely flipped him over his extended arm, taking his sword from him in the process. <br> &nbsp;<br> The woman advanced with a good deal more prudence, but �eda wasted no time. Gripping the shamshir with both hands, she beat the woman&#x2019;s initial swing up, dodged when the expected downward swing came, and brought her shamshir down across the woman&#x2019;s sword with a mighty two-handed chop. The woman lost her grip on it, and the sword clanged loudly against the stone. <br> &nbsp;<br> Things were escalating far too quickly, but when the woman made the foolish decision to reach for her lost sword, �eda had no choice but to hold the man&#x2019;s shamshir against her throat. Thankfully, she took it no further, choosing instead to stand and back away, hands raised.</p><h2>Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys: The Big Lie</h2><p>A Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys mystery unlike any other you&#x2019;ve ever read! When the teenage brothers Frank and Joe Hardy are accused of the murder of their father &#x2013; a detective in the small resort town of Bayport &#x2013; they must team up with Nancy Drew to prove their innocence (and find the real guilty party in the process) in a twisting noir tale, complete with double-crosses, deceit, and dames. Writer Anthony Del Col (Assassin&#x2019;s Creed, Kill Shakespeare) and artist Werther Dell&#x2019;Edera (Batman: Detective Comics, House of Mystery) bring the iconic teen detectives into the modern age, and redefine noir for a new generation of readers!<br> <br> Reviews:<br> <br> "There&#x2019;s murder. There&#x2019;s mystery. There&#x2019;s danger. Most of all, there&#x2019;s abundant joy in the reading." &#x2013; BiffBamPop<br> <br> &#x201c;Mystery fans, fans of the original series, and fans of Hope Larson and Brittney Williams&#x2019; Goldie Vance will likely enjoy Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys for its vintage charm, amped-up drama, and superb art.&#x201d; &#x2013; Graphic Policy<br> <br> &#x201c;This might be the best &#x2018;modern&#x2019; approach to updating a franchise like this that I&#x2019;ve seen.

An enormously pleasant surprise. &#x2013; CBR<br></p><p>BOOKLIST -- While some of us old fogeys will lament the darkening of these stalwart, all-American kid detectives, teens will find this disillusioned and gritty version of great interest. The sunny town of Bayport has a dark underbelly. Police detective Fenton Hardy is dead and disgraced, and his sons Frank and Joe stand accused of his murder. Enter tough-as-nails Nancy, who helps them infiltrate the Bayport underworld to clear themselves and uncover the truth about Dad. Del Col creates an interesting friction between the brothers, but it's Nancy who drives the plot with a feisty confidence and hard-boiled dialogue that she maintains even through her own tragic familial revelations. While the three are all enterprising and brave, for famous detectives, they do virtually no actual deducting, making the familiar crime elements somewhat less riveting for it. The visuals, though, stand out for the international art team's subtly nonstandard sensibilities. The refined gestures and body language of characters, the somber blues and seeping noir shadows, and even the unusual integration of the sound effects create an enjoyably distinct world.<i>- Jesse Karp</i> <br><br><br>In <i>Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys: The Big Lie</i>, Detective Fenton Hardy has been murdered, and the Bayport police think Joe and Frank murdered their father. The boys, high school teens, face session after session in the police station, interrogated by Chief Collig and Detective Peterson. It turns out that was the plan, concocted by their friend Nancy. Someone framed Fenton Hardy and made him look like a crooked cop before murdering him, and the teens decide to play a very dangerous game to prove Detective Hardy's innocence and find the actual murderer. This story is not for children, but for high school-age readers; everything in the book, from the tough characters to the somewhat seedy atmosphere in Bayport to the dark-toned art lends to the strongly noir mystery. Nobody, including Nancy and the Hardy boys, are quite what they appear; everyone has secrets here. Older teens who enjoy mysteries and anyone who thought that the classic Nancy Drew and the Hardy boys were too good to be true will enjoy this story.<br>-VOYA<br></p><h2>John Paul II to Aristotle and Back Again: A Christian Philosophy of Life</h2><p>Have you ever struggled to explain the basics of a Christian worldview, particularly as it concerns God&#39;s existence and his relation to the natural order, the basics of morality, even sexual ethics? Utilizing the thought of the late Pope John Paul II and the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, Dr. Andrew Swafford has done just this. This book explains the philosophical underpinnings of a Christian worldview-in a way that is accessible to the general reader--discussing God&#39;s existence, faith and reason, a tour through a virtue-ethics which leads to authentic happiness (and discussing the seven deadly sins along the way), as well as John Paul II&#39;s teaching on the &#34;language&#34; of the body and the meaning of the human vocation to make a gift of one&#39;s self. The reader will come away with a deep understanding of the philosophical foundations for the Christian life.</p><p>Andrew Swafford holds a doctorate in Sacred Theology from the University of St. Mary of the Lake and an MA in Old Testament and Semitic Languages from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. He is the author of Nature and Grace: A New Approach to Thomistic Ressourcement and contributing author to Divinization. Currently, he is an assistant professor of Theology at Benedictine College in Atchison, KS where he resides with his wife and four children.''With the publication of <i>Nature and Grace: A New Approach to Thomistic Ressourcement</i>, Andrew Dean Swafford was introduced as an interesting and insightful thinker of the new Thomistic renewal. In his eminently accessible <i>John Paul II to Aristotle and Back Again</i>, Swafford shows us how the designs of nature fit into God's design for the happy life. Because human persons, authentic virtue, and true freedom matter, this book matters.''<br>--Cajetan Cuddy OP, Parochial Vicar, St. Joseph's Church in Greenwich Village<br><br>''Here is winsome wisdom and uncommon commonsense about good and evil and the meaning of life. All high school seniors and college freshmen should read it. It is a little look at the 'big picture' of the good life, both natural and supernatural, and the perfect 'fit' between these two dimensions. Putting Aristotle and St. John Paul II together is a marriage made in heaven.''<br>--Peter Kreeft, Professor of Philosophy, Boston College<br><br>''In this work, Swafford rightly exhorts us Catholics to 'spend more time explaining our paradigm than simply engaging in arguments aimed at persuasion.' Open this book and step into that Catholic worldview--a paradigm that sheds light on God, virtue, friendship, and sexuality, and leads us on the true path to human happiness.''<br>--Edward Sri, Professor of Theology, Augustine Institute --Wipf and Stock Publishers</p><h2>Ralph Compton Comanche Trail (A Ralph Compton Western)</h2><p><b>In this Ralph Compton western, a man rides for vengenace and into danger...</b><br><br>Thad Taylor is no one&#x2019;s idea of a fine man.

His recollection of the previous night was hidden away in a drunken fog&#x2014;too many whiskeys and an argument in Stubby&#x2019;s saloon down the dusty Independence, Kansas, main street, a flying chair or two, then a full-scale free-for-all. The fact that one eye was almost swollen shut, his knuckles were raw and blood-crusted, and his ribs felt as if an anvil had been dropped on them was all the hungover Taylor needed to realize he&#x2019;d been on the losing end of whatever fight he&#x2019;d likely instigated.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t the first time.</p><p>He was making a futile attempt to smooth his tangled rusty brown hair and wipe the dried vomit from his torn shirt when he saw his sister glaring at him from a nearby buggy. Once again the sheriff had called her to fetch him and, despite earlier vows that she would never again do so, she had come to take him home.</p><p>Thad nodded in her direction, aware that a tongue-lashing was soon to come.</p><p>&#x201c;Get in, Thaddeus,&#x201d; Sister said, hoping passersby would not take notice and quickly spread the word that the doctor&#x2019;s boy had again gotten himself in trouble with the law.</p><p>He ran his fingers through his hair again. &#x201c;Gotta find my hat,&#x201d; he mumbled through swollen lips.</p><p>&#x201c;Get in . . . right this minute.&#x201d; Her tone made it clear that finding his hat would have to wait.</p><p>They rode in silence on the trip out to the Taylor Farm, sweat beading on Thad&#x2019;s forehead despite the cool morning breeze. Sister kept her eyes focused on the mare in front of her, her knuckles white as she held tightly to the reins and her temper.</p><p>The weathered old farmhouse was in view before she finally spoke. &#x201c;Thaddeus,&#x201d; she said, careful not to look toward him, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re past your twentieth year and still whoring and drinking and carousing, doing absolutely nothing worthwhile with your life. It&#x2019;s a shame, if you ask me. Are you ever going to amount to anything?&#x201d; A tear ran down her cheek as she spoke.</p><p>&#x201c;Reckon not.&#x201d; He was sorry for his response as soon as the words escaped his mouth. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my horse?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unlike you, he came home last night,&#x201d; Sister said. &#x201c;I unsaddled him and put him in the barn.&#x201d; She gave him a stern look. &#x201c;Just like I always do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Much better than you. I&#x2019;m just glad Daddy&#x2019;s away and not here to see what a frightful mess you are.&#x201d;</p><p>After cleaning up and pouring himself a cup of coffee from the pot that hung above the fireplace, Taylor declined Sister&#x2019;s offer of breakfast. His stomach churned at the very thought of food. Instead he headed toward the barn and the small room he&#x2019;d converted from what was once a place for storing saddles and tools back when the home place was still a working farm. It had only a bed and a small chest, most of its faded paint peeled away. But the place provided him solitude, away from the big house that he&#x2019;d stormed out of three years earlier, following yet another argument with his father.</p><p>He fell onto the bed, resting an arm across his eyes, hoping the dizziness would soon go away. And, as was his routine following each of his boozy misadventures, he took stock of his miserable station in life. As was always the case, he didn&#x2019;t like the scenes that played in his mind.</p><p>His father, Independence&#x2019;s only doctor, was one of those bigger-than-life characters. He&#x2019;d lost count of how many children, his own included, he&#x2019;d helped bring into the world, how many broken bones he&#x2019;d mended and lives he&#x2019;d saved. If the stories Thad had heard since boyhood were true, Dr. Winslow Taylor, a portly Scottish immigrant with a booming voice, had been a fun-loving man in his younger days. He was quick to help out friends and neighbors, ever ready to buy the first round on Saturday nights, loved dancing, playing the fiddle. And, above all, his wife.</p><p>That he had been unable to save her life when complications developed following his son&#x2019;s birth had changed Dr. Taylor forever. His good nature disappeared, his delight in the company of others waned. While he continued to carry about his medical responsibilities in a professional manner, he was never the same after Maggie Taylor was buried. Doc Taylor became a bitter man. Often, on late nights when he sat alone in his library, sipping whiskey and smoking his pipe, he would quietly talk to himself. His words, part curse, part an expression of haunting disbelief, were always the same: I can heal others but couldn&#x2019;t save my own.</p><p>The only thing that brightened his spirits was his daughter, Peggy, whom everyone had begun calling Sister even before her younger brother was born. She had her mother&#x2019;s features&#x2014;high cheekbones, eyes so blue as to be almost hypnotic, shiny auburn hair&#x2014;and a warm, generous nature. In Sister&#x2019;s company, Dr. Taylor was able to think back on happier times.</p><p>Thad, on the other hand, was a constant reminder of the darkest day in his life. And, while the doctor had never said as much, his son was certain that he was blamed daily for the death of his mother. Thad had long since resigned himself to being the family curse, robber of all of his father&#x2019;s joy. He&#x2019;d so balked at the doctor&#x2019;s insistence that education was the path to a man&#x2019;s success that when he&#x2019;d stopped going to the schoolhouse, no argument was offered. Whatever small effort at guidance the elder Taylor had tried ended in such grand failure that he&#x2019;d long since halted the useless exercise. By the time Thaddeus reached adulthood, he couldn&#x2019;t even remember when he&#x2019;d finally given up on any effort to win the doctor&#x2019;s approval.</p><p>In exchange for doing handyman jobs around the farm&#x2014;milking, mucking out stalls, carpentry when the roof of the house leaked, clearing brush, and tilling Sister&#x2019;s summer garden&#x2014;he lived on the family place and enjoyed his sister&#x2019;s cooking. Otherwise, he and his father were as distant as strangers, seldom speaking, seeing each other rarely, and then only from a safe distance.</p><p>What little money Thad earned came from odd jobs he did for folks in town who occasionally tried to reach out to the young man whose life they perceived to be painfully lonely, filled with anger, and without real purpose.</p><p>If Independence had a bona fide outcast, it was Thaddeus Taylor.</p><p>� � �</p><p>The day was nearing an end under a gray sky that was forewarning a thunderstorm by the time he was wakened by a gentle knock at his door and the sound of Sister&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;You feeling good enough to eat something?&#x201d; On her arm was a basket that held a plate of tomatoes, corn bread, beans and bacon, and a large slice of apple pie.</p><p>&#x201c;Looks like I&#x2019;m gonna live,&#x201d; he said as he realized that his appetite had returned.</p><p>Sister sat silently watching her brother as he began to eat ravenously. He wasn&#x2019;t exactly a handsome man, she thought, but if one looked beyond the bruises, swollen eye, and unkempt hair, overlooked his need for a shave and new clothes and another ten pounds on his skinny frame, there was something about Thaddeus Taylor that she assumed women might find attractive. Not just whores, but good women like those who attended church at the Calvary&#x2019;s Cross Baptist. She was certain she wouldn&#x2019;t always be the only one to love her brother&#x2014;if he straightened up.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry about what I said today,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Thad smiled for the first time since he&#x2019;d been released from the jail. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard worse,&#x201d; he replied as he buried his fork into the apple pie.</p><p>After gathering the emptied plates, she sat beside him on the bed. &#x201c;You up to talking for a bit? I&#x2019;ve got something on my mind that&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know I&#x2019;ve said it before, but this time I swear on the Good Book that I ain&#x2019;t going back to Stubby&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what&#x2019;s worrying me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What, then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been over three weeks since Daddy left to go visit Uncle Dalton in Fort Scott. Dalton&#x2019;s getting up in years, you know, and he&#x2019;s not at all healthy, so Daddy felt it was time to look in on him, maybe talk him into coming here to live with us. But he told me he wouldn&#x2019;t be gone more than two weeks, since Julie Simpson&#x2014;you know her, she works at the grocery in town&#x2014;is going to be having her baby soon. It&#x2019;s not like him to delay his return and ignore her needs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t even know he was gone,&#x201d; Thad said.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway, the last couple of nights I&#x2019;ve been having these awful dreams. In them, bad things are happening to Daddy, like Indians getting him or some outlaws knocking him in the head and robbing him. I know it sounds crazy. But the truth of the matter is I&#x2019;m getting really scared.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And just what is it you want me to do about it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want you to go find him.&#x201d;</p><p>� � �</p><p>A bright eruption of stars had filled the moonless, cloud-free sky after the rainstorm. It was still a couple of hours before daylight and there was a clean, newly washed smell in the prairie air as Taylor stood at the entrance of the barn, a packed saddlebag draped over one shoulder.</p><p>He&#x2019;d slept little. Instead he had listened to the gentle rhythm of the rain on the roof as he contemplated his sister&#x2019;s request. Go find him. Where? How? And, perhaps most puzzling of all to him, why?</p><p>He was saddling his sorrel, Magazine, when he sensed that he was not alone. In the flickering light of a nearby coal oil lantern, he made out the image of his sister standing in the doorway.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to do it,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Her brother shrugged. &#x201c;Got nothing better to do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come up to the house before you leave. Coffee&#x2019;s about ready.&#x201d;</p><p>Carefully laid out on the kitchen table was a knotted bandanna filled with freshly baked biscuits, a hat her father wore when he was making his rounds to visit patients, and his hunting rifle.</p><p>And there was a small gold-framed photograph of their mother and father. &#x201c;Could be that you might need this if you need to make inquiries,&#x201d; Sister said. &#x201c;Of course, it was taken when he was considerably younger, but it&#x2019;s the only likeness I have.&#x201d;</p><p>Taylor gave the picture only a glance. Instead he focused on the Winchester and laughed. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t hit the side of a sizable barn with that thing. I ain&#x2019;t exactly got a reputation as a gunfighter, you know.&#x201d; The fact was, he&#x2019;d never even owned a sidearm.</p><p>&#x201c;I doubt it would be a barn you&#x2019;d be aiming at if you found yourself facing some kind of serious trouble.&#x201d; She handed him a pouch filled with ammunition, then reached into her apron and produced a small white kerchief knotted around a fistful of coins.</p><p>Her brother sipped from his coffee cup and shook his head.</p><p>&#x201c;You take it and don&#x2019;t argue,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t you dare go spending it all on whiskey and foolish amusements.&#x201d; She put her arms around him, burying her face against his shoulder. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m expecting you back real soon, you hear?&#x201d;</p><p>He reached for the doctor&#x2019;s hat and wasn&#x2019;t surprised when it fell across his bruised forehead and rested against his ears. He sighed. &#x201c;Figures that it&#x2019;d be too big.&#x201d;</p><p>Sister put a hand to her mouth to hide her smile.</p><p><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p>Aside from a lone coyote that appeared from an alley and stopped in the middle of the muddy street to watch him pass, Independence was quiet as Taylor began his northward journey. Even the morning birds had not yet begun to sing, and no rooster&#x2019;s crow had signaled the arrival of a new day. Whoever might have taken his place in Sheriff Henry&#x2019;s jail was still lost in tortured sleep, and the saloon was dark and quiet. Thad welcomed the solitude as he passed the deserted general store, the livery, and the hotel, making his way toward the open plains.</p><p>He was without any real plan, aside from following the trail that led north toward Fort Scott. Once the route of Indians following buffalo herds, it would take him along the Kansas-Missouri border, across miles of flatlands, past an occasional way station and a few small communities established by ambitious settlers. Depending on Magazine&#x2019;s willingness, Taylor judged that it would take him three days to reach the home of Uncle Dalton, a man he&#x2019;d not seen since he was a child.</p><p>Likely as not, he would arrive to find his uncle and the doctor sitting on the front porch, sipping whiskey, talking of old times, and arguing the virtues of Dalton taking leave of his home to make the trip back to Independence. Taylor would make his father aware of Sister&#x2019;s worry, urge that he consider a prompt return, and offer to help with the loading of Uncle Dalton&#x2019;s belongings in the event he&#x2019;d decided to take the doctor up on his offer.</p><p>Once the sun rose, its warmth felt good on his aching body, and he&#x2019;d begun to sense a small measure of purpose to his journey. While he didn&#x2019;t share his sister&#x2019;s concern for the well-being of his father, believing that his delayed return was nothing more than a matter of his own choosing, the rider was enjoying the sights and sounds of the flatlands through which he was traveling. He&#x2019;d not seen another person or even a settler&#x2019;s cabin since sunup.</p><p>By noon he reached a small creek and dismounted to allow Magazine to drink and graze while he sat in the shade of a small stand of mesquites, eating a couple of the biscuits Sister had sent with him. Taylor had closed his eyes and was about to doze when he suddenly felt the presence of someone standing over him.</p><p>It was a boy, no more than ten or twelve, wearing overalls and a frayed straw hat.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a mighty big hat you&#x2019;re wearing, mister,&#x201d; the youngster said.</p><p>Taylor smiled. &#x201c;Borrowed it off a giant. What brings you here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Been fishing since sunup. Pa said it would be okay if I promised to bring home enough catfish for supper.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Catching anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201d;</p><p>The boy introduced himself as Jakey Barstow as they made their way down the creek bank, where he lifted a length of rope from the muddy water to display half a dozen fish.</p><p>&#x201c;By the look of things, I&#x2019;d guess you&#x2019;re a pretty fair fisherman. Where&#x2019;d you come from?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Our cabin&#x2019;s &#x2019;bout a mile past that ridge,&#x201d; he said, pointing to the west. &#x201c;Me, my pa, and Ma come here from Tennessee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, then, welcome to Kansas, Mr. Jakey Barstow. We&#x2019;re glad to have you and your folks settled in our fine state.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My pa says we&#x2019;re likely to have neighbors real soon, maybe even a town one of these days.

The book shows the type of electrostatic motor that was first invented by Ben Franklin in 1748. It also reviews and illustrates electric pendulum motors, electric wind motors, Franklin's spark motors, capacitor motors, inductance motors, corona motors, liquid immersed motors, electret motors and more. The last chapter shows how the electrostatic motor can be designed to be powered by atmospheric electricity, which Professor Jefimenko experimented with at the University of West Virginia. The author is very meticulous to give dates and references for the historical use of particularly unique electrostatic motors. Dr. Jefimenko's articles from <i>Popular Science</i> magazine are reprinted in the Appendix for those who want to build their own electrostatic motor. He also reviews the atmospheric potential for generating energy, pointing out it is in the gigawatt range. The book also includes his review article on the earth's electric field as a natural source of electrostatic energy.</p><p>Professor Jefimenko (1922-2009) was hard-working, gifted, and lucky. He was born in the Ukraine. Caught in the buildup to World War II, he was forced into the Russian army and sent to Siberia for training. He was wounded at the Russian-German front, avoided capture and received medical treatment from a witch-doctor in a nearby village. Later he was apprehended and sent to a German work camp. His independent spirit attracted attention and extra beatings from guards. He managed to trade food rations with another prisoner for a book written in Russian about how to speak German. Guards stopped beating him once he began to speak their language. He improved his situation by learning to run a metal lathe and spent the rest of his time in the camp machining gun barrels. After the war he studied physics at the University of Goettingen, Germany (Vordiplom, 1950) where he attended lectures of famous scientists of those times. He married and came to the United States in search of new opportunity. His formal education was completed at Lewis and Clark College, Portland Oregon (BA, 1952), and University of Oregon (MA, 1954 and PhD, 1956). Oleg spent his entire career at West Virginia University Department of Physics. His lectures were enlivened by lecture room demonstrations. Most novel was his water stream loop-the-loop . Oleg s serious research work involved both theory and experimental aspects of spectroscopy, electricity and magnetism, and electrostatics. After retirement he had more time to explore new topics and wrote books on gravitation - cogravitational fields, electromagnetic retardation, and relativity.Dr. Oleg Dmitrovich Jefimenko (1922-2009) was among the most valued of contributors to the Electric Spacecraft Journal. He supplied ESJ with review copies of his books, including <i>Electrostatic Motors: Their History, Types, and Principles of Operation; Electromagnetic Retardation and Theory of Relativity: New Chapters in the Classical Theory of Fields; Causality, Electromagnetic Induction, and Gravitation: A Different Approach to the Theory of Electromagnetic and Gravitational Fields; and Electricity and Magnetism: An Introduction to the Theory of Electric and Magnetic Fields</i>. ESJ reviewed his ideas on retardation, current density, and various atomic clocks in previous journals. (See ESJ 6:37-38, 22:38-39, 31:6-9, and 40:25-27.) The following review of Electrostatic Motors is presented as a tribute in honor of the life work of a serious investigator in the physical sciences, who shared ESJ s passion for questioning assumptions, while never letting go of empiricism and reason. Undertaking investigations into electrostatics in the early 1970s, Jefimenko found the field largely abandoned. Toys had been created as curiosities in the 1700s, when the science was too primitive to take seriously. Jefimenko found the written record replete with colorful commentary, but devoid of quantitative analyses. His research into the topic included consulting ancient texts, forgotten journals, and museum closets where a lot of electrostatic machines had been stored for lack of understanding. The main reason electrostatic motors had not been taken seriously is that great voltages are required for their operation, and ESD is always working against the maintenance of high voltages. Nonetheless, some electrostatic motors have been built that run off input voltages in excess of 100 kV; others operate with currents on the order of nanoamps. One pendulum type electrostatic motor at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, operated nonstop off a Zamboni pile for eighty-six years. Another class of electrostatic motors would be the corona motors, developed by W. Holtz and J. C. Poggendorff. They consisted basically in the running of Wimshurst generators in reverse. A combination of fallacious appeals to authority and circular reasoning prevented the public s imagination from being captured to convert these machines into anything useful. A very different class of motors, known as capacitor motors, was invented by Karl Zipernowski. These motors consisted of a four-blade flat fan rotating between two brass cutouts of the same size and shape. Another unusual class of electrostatic motors is the electret motors. Electrets are permanently charged dielectrics, the electrical analogy of permanent magnets. A. N. Gubkin made the first electret motor. It consisted of diametrically situated electrets. The electret paddle was free to rotate through the dielectric spaces of two diametrically-situated capacitors. The polarity of the capacitors was regulated by commutators. Jefimenko had high hopes for a clean, renewable source of energy that would make electrostatic motors feasible. He invested a lot of effort attempting to harness appreciable horsepower from altitude induced potential differences in the atmosphere. --Electric Spacecraft Journal, Issue 47, March 30, 2011<br><br>This is an outstanding book not to be missed by anyone who is interested in energy generation. It is the best source of information and history regarding atmospheric electricity powering a motor and the various types of electrostatic motors that are suitable for atmopheric conversion of energy. The author, Professor Oleg Jefimenko from West Virginia University, estimated the potential energy reserve of the atmospheric electricity to be 200 gigawatts. Therefore, this book provides the impetus for a new source of energy, especially in dry climates where it can be utilized throughout the year. --Thomas Valone, PhD, PE</p><h2>The Dragon Scroll: A Mystery of Ancient Japan Featuring Sugawara Akitada</h2><p>In an adventure filled with highway bandits, unscrupulous politicians, and renegade monks, <b>The Dragon Scroll</b> introduces readers to the lively world of eleventh-century Japan and an irrepressible hero&#x2014;Sugawara Akitada.

She writes regularly for <b>Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s Mystery Magazine</b>.Shamus-winner Parker's impressive third Sugawara Akitada mystery (after 2003's <i>The Hell Screen</i>) deftly pulls the reader into the world of 11th-century Japan. Someone sets up Akitada, a young junior clerk in the ministry of justice, to fail on his first assignment, which is to travel to the province of Kazusa and track down the thieves responsible for missing tax shipments from that remote region. While Akitada's suspicions center on Kazusa's governor, he has to rethink his plans when the governor's predecessor, who had requested a clandestine meeting with Akitada, is murdered. Before he can make much headway solving either crime, Akitada is recalled to the capital, where he faces additional challenges. Parker manages the impressive feat of presenting a classic whodunit in an exotic and unfamiliar setting. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Why must you reach for more?</i><br>&#x201c;Near, my lady!&#x201d; Beleval shouted, his voice loud enough to cut through the roar of the storm. <i>Near to the Sanctuary of the Star.</i><br>Near to safety. Near to revenge.<br>Pain gripped her, this wave coming sooner than the last, and when it passed she tasted the blood from where she&#x2019;d bitten her lip. She had been upon the birthing couch when the traitors had come. That the child had delayed even from nightfall to nightfall was more grace than she had hoped for; the unborn babe would not grant her yet more clemency. She must be delivered soon or this nightmare ride would have been for nothing.<br>Only within the Sanctuary of the Star could she be safe.<br>The bright call of a warhorn sheared through the noise of their flight and jarred her back to full consciousness. Any daughter of the Hundred Houses learned early the strategies and treacheries an enemy might use to gain what it wished. She knew their pursuers had no need to signal an intended attack. It was an attempt to startle the prey into rash action, so they might be easily taken.<br>The horn called again, closer.<br>Suddenly Nataranweiya found herself alone. Moments later the full fury of the storm struck her; so much water was flung at her by the wind that she coughed and choked on it. The shock was so great that in her exhaustion it took her precious heartbeats to understand what had happened. <i>Beleval and Dioniron have turned back.</i><br>The three of them had been in the lead. If Beleval and Dioniron had turned back to throw themselves against their pursuers, the others had as well.<br><i>Farewell, farewell, friends, companions, cousins! We shall meet again in Tildorangelor, beneath the trees.... </i><br>She would have wept, save that her tears had all been shed long before. Now the sky must do her mourning. She could not open her eyes against the wind to search for the lights ahead, but they must be there. They must.<br>Her mount&#x2019;s gait was even more jarring now. It had run the sun down out of the sky, its drug-maddened gallop as unchanging as the beat of drums. Even in her exhausted, pain-racked state, Nataranweiya knew the instant that rhythm changed. The horse slowed from a gallop to a jarring trot, forced itself to a gallop again, staggered to a stiff-legged exhausted canter and held there. Nataranweiya could hear the desperate whistling sound it made as it fought for air, for <i>life</i>&#x2014;<br>The animal lost its fight between one step and the next. She felt its muscles go slack, even as the hot blood of its death sprayed her, she was already kicking her feet free of the stirrups and releasing her cold-cramped grip on its reins. She must throw herself from the saddle or be trapped beneath its body when she fell. Who had first taught her that? She no longer remembered; nor was she the bright slender girl who had learned that lesson any longer. She screamed at another wave of pain that rose just as she flung herself free. <i>Hurry, you must hurry, they will hear, they will follow.... </i>Then all thoughts were driven from her mind until it passed.<br>She crawled from beside the horse&#x2019;s body as soon as she could. With shaking fingers she ripped the jeweled clasp of her fine fur cloak open, shedding its sodden weight in the mud.<br><i>Hurry. To your feet, witless girl, you must run now.... </i><br>She crawled.<br>Three times she was forced to halt by the agonizing pressure on her abdomen. She barely knew when she reached the Sanctuary gates. They stood eternally open in both warning and promise that no conflict might enter here. She clawed herself to her feet along one pillar.<br><i>Beyond the gate. Inside. You are not safe until you are within. Not safe. Not safe&nbsp;... </i><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>For six centuries Maeredhiel had served the Sanctuary of the Star. Let the children come and go in their season, let a new Astromancer be chosen each time the ever-living Vilya bore its fruit; what was that to her? Maeredhiel had made for herself a place and a peace that none would take from her. Did not Lightborn need to eat and sleep? Did not the workrooms and stillrooms run more smoothly when there was a proper supply of herbs and fruits to hand for decoction and enchanting?<br>And did not young Candidates tear their tunics and outgrow their sandals, here just as within the walls of the Keep in which she had been born?<br>The time was late, and tomorrow as always would be a day of much work, yet Maeredhiel found she could not sleep. She had already checked the storerooms and the sleeping rooms for possible storm damage, and even visited the high tower where Celelioniel spent so many nights. The Astromancer had not gone there tonight, for clouds had obscured her beloved stars, but still Maeredhiel was uneasy. Tonight&#x2019;s storm was fierce and unseasonable.<br><i>Fool!</i> she berated herself. <i>Are you yourself an Astromancer, to know the stories the stars whisper? What troubles you is indigestion and age, nothing more.</i><br>She hesitated in the antechamber of the Shrine, adjusting her hooded shawl. It was always as bright as summer noon here, for the walls and ceiling shone with Silverlight renewed again and again since the day Mosirinde Peacemaker had first set this place apart. The stone floor was inlaid with a silver wheel whose arms pointed the true directions, and the ceiling was inlaid with the star pictures that edged the Hunt-road. It was both promise and warning, as was the depiction of the Silver Hooves themselves upon the great bronze doors at the far end of the chamber. Beyond those doors stood the Shrine of the Star itself.<br>As if her musings had summoned Them, the antechamber was filled with a sudden blast of cold.<br><i>No one would come to the Sanctuary in this storm merely to bid us good greeting,</i> Maeredhiel thought in alarm. She clapped her hands to summon the servants&#x2014;the simple cantrip she wore on a string about her neck ensured her summons would be heard in their bedchambers&#x2014;and hurried to open the inner door. Gusts of wet wind skirled around her and she turned her head away.<br>&#x201c;... please...&#x201d; The word was the faintest of whispers.<br><i>How did you come here?</i> Maeredhiel wondered, gazing down at the bundle of muddy rags barely discernible as a living body. She stepped over the body to pull the outer doors back into place, peering out as she did, but if any followed, they were as dark as the storm.<br>&#x201c;Mistress, what&#x2014;?&#x201d; It was Elithreth, one of the Candidates in his Service Year.<br>&#x201c;What else but someone seeking Sanctuary?&#x201d; Maeredhiel answered. &#x201c;A woman, and with child,&#x201d; she finished smoothly. &#x201c;So use care.&#x201d;<br>With Elithreth&#x2019;s help, Maeredhiel lifted the supplicant to her feet and helped her inside. Many came to the Sanctuary of the Star seeking that which only it could supply. Normally such a one would place a hand upon the bronze doors of the Shrine and make their formal petition before being sent to hospital or resting chamber. Maeredhiel did not think this one had that much strength left in her body&#x2014;if she and Elithreth had not supported her, she would have collapsed. Every footstep she took left pools of muddy, bloody water upon the stone floor, but in the stronger light of the antechamber, Maeredhiel saw the glitter of silver, moonsilver, and gems.<br><i>Noble&#x2014;and with child&#x2014;and hurt&#x2014;and alone.</i> None of these things boded well for the peace of the Sanctuary. &#x201c;Your name and your House, Lady?&#x201d; Maeredhiel asked, her voice low and urgent.

He always looked tired or mad about something, or sometimes just sad.<br><br>His name was Jamie Marks. But everyone called him Moony.<br><br>I'm not sure when or where or why he got the name, but I think it had something to do with him being fifteen years old and still a Boy Scout. It wasn't a good nickname or anything, and I sometimes wondered why, when guys in the eleventh and twelfth grades would sometimes shout in the hallways, "Hey, Moony! Moony Marks!" and laugh like idiots, Jamie didn't do anything to stop them. He'd just pretend like he hadn't heard. Sometimes there'd be a scuffle. One of the jerks wouldn't be satisfied with his silence, so they'd push him into a locker and say stupid shit like, "Speak when you're spoken to, Moony!" But he must have been a Boy Scout through and through, because he never did anything in retaliation. He just slid further down into the bottom of his existence, far away where they couldn't reach him.<br><br>When we were freshmen we started sitting next to each other in our computer classes. I didn't understand computers much beyond playing games on them, so he sometimes helped me. I never asked. Whenever he saw me stuck, he'd just offer his services. His voice was soft, not hard like I'd imagined it would be after everything. He was a good kid, really. I wished I knew how to be friends with him.<br><br>That summer I turned fifteen, and when fall came around again, I was put on the varsity cross-country team. I was a good runner. I did a mile in under four and a half minutes. My mother always called me her bolt of lightning. Then she'd tell the same old story again, the one about how I was born after forty hours of labor and how my lungs were undersized and there was a murmur in my heart. "The doctors didn't think you'd live," she'd tell me, or whoever happened to be around to listen. "But you were a fighter, my brave boy. You always fought to live."<br><br>I suppose I should probably say a word or two about my mother and the rest of my family.<br><br>We live in a white, one-story ranch house on a back road of a small town in Ohio. My father built the house right after he and my mom married, with some help from a few of his friends. He was a construction worker, proud of the buildings his hands brought into existence. When we drove around the countryside or through one of the nearby towns, he'd point out places he'd had a hand in making. He'd say things like, "Did the closets in that one," and would point out my window, his finger drifting in front of my face. I never knew what he was trying to tell me, so I'd just nod, considering the fine black hairs that curled along his arm. It didn't matter how I responded. Most of the time, my dad never had much to say.<br><br>My mom, on the other hand, is a talker. She could outtalk anyone, except maybe my grandma. <br><br>Mostly she has a good bit of advice or a word of encouragement for everyone. Usually she's in good spirits, unless she and my dad have fought, and when that happens she can be black for days and everyone knows to stay away. I remember in one of her worst moments she stopped me on my way to my room and said, "Don't ever put your happiness in someone else's hands. They'll drop it. They'll drop it every time." She'll always come around eventually, her smile settled back on her face like an advertisement for happiness, but I never believed in that smile except when I was a little kid and didn't know better. I learned early that smiles lie.<br><br>Along with my parents is my brother, Andy. He's two years older than me. He was a senior when I started running on the varsity track team. Sometimes teachers called me his name and, after realizing their mistake, said, "I'm sorry. Adam. Adam McCormick. Let's hope you're a bit more serious than your brother."<br><br>I'm a bit more serious, I guess. All of my teachers realized that quickly. Soon after their initial worry over me being like Andy, who was known for being a part of what you might call the burnout heavy metal crowd that cut class and always smelled like pot, they started making remarks on essays I wrote or on tests I'd taken that said, "Very good, Adam! You're on the right track! Keep it up!"<br><br>This was before all of the bad stuff started to happen. Or I should say this was before all of the bad stuff started to happen that had been coming into existence for years beforehand. It's just that none of us recognized it at first. Or I should say it's just that none of us recognized it except my grandma, who died in the spring when I was still fourteen and a freshman in high school. She'd come to live with us after my grandpa died of lung cancer and she'd been with us for a year when I went into her bedroom one morning to wake her for breakfast and found her dead.<br><br>Before she died, we'd gotten used to my grandma predicting a great misfortune coming. She always had odd sayings and rhymes to explain anything out of the ordinary. My parents said she was from the old country and never gave up that kind of thinking, but I always thought what she said made a sort of sense. And what she'd been saying for several months before she died was, "God's finger is coming. I see it in the sky. If you people aren't careful, he's going to pick you out for sadness."<br>To me she said, "If you see his finger coming, boy, run. Run as fast and as far away as you can. Understand?"<br><br>I nodded and she smiled, the wrinkles in her face folding. She patted my hand. The skin on her palms was soft and felt like it would slide right off her bones. I sat on the edge of her bed and said, "I'll run as fast and as far away as possible. I'll keep my eyes out for God's finger. I promise."<br><br>But I guess I wasn't paying enough attention. Maybe it was because my grandma had been gone half a year by the time the signs began appearing, and by then I'd forgotten. "Bad things come in threes," she always said. But I understand now that sometimes you don't recognize a string of bad things until they're right on top of you.<br><br>The first bad thing that happened was that Jamie Marks disappeared in late September. One day he sat next to me in the computer lab, and the next day his seat was empty.<br><br>The last time I saw him, I was running home from cross-country practice. The Marks house was on my way back. It sat down from the road in a hollow, gray and ashy, surrounded by maple trees and weeping willows. Red and orange leaves littered the front yard, and a small gray shed stood off to the side of the house with the nose of a tractor poking out. Four dog coops sat in the yard, one at each corner: two under the trees near the road, two under the trees near the house, and the dogs themselves ran back and forth on chains tied to the trees, patrolling. A long drive curled down the hill from the road, back to the shed. The drive was really just tire ruts from where Mr. Marks drove an eighteen-wheeler up and down the lawn from the road. He drove for a company in Youngstown, an hour away from here, and hardly anyone in town ever saw him.<br><br>Whenever I ran past the Marks house, I couldn't help but look at the window over the kitchen to see if Jamie was there. I'd seen him there the previous spring on a day soon after my grandma died, watching me run. So after that, whenever I ran past, I'd look to see if he was watching.<br><br>The dogs barked angrily as I passed, but Jamie wasn't in the window on the last day I saw him. He came walking up the rutted drive in his Boy Scout uniform to get the mail instead. I waved and he waved back like we were friends, and I guess we were sort of, but not really. Not yet. I thought about asking why he was a Boy Scout, but I kept running instead. Then he suddenly shouted, "Looking good, McCormick!" and stopped me in my tracks.<br><br>I kept lifting my knees up, going nowhere, while he came to the mailbox, flipped the lid up and pulled out the usual stack of grocery store coupons and Have You Seen Me? postcards with pictures of missing kids on them. He looked up then and--I'll always remember this--said, "Nothing ever comes that's worth anything anyway."<br><br>He said this as if he'd been expecting better, as if something that would change the world as soon as he opened the envelope was supposed to arrive that day. I didn't say anything. I was satisfied watching him sort mail. Looking at his uniform and the round glasses sliding down his nose, I wondered if maybe the glasses didn't have something to do with his nickname. I never did ask, though. Sometimes you regret things like that. Sometimes you regret not asking simple questions.<br>The uniform looked strange on him, but maybe only because I'd never joined the Boy Scouts. I tried picturing him wearing my clothes instead, but when I opened my mouth I said, "That's a cool uniform."<br><br>He was as surprised by the compliment as I was, but he managed to say thanks, even though it was obvious he didn't believe me.<br><br>He asked what I thought about the program we learned in computer lab that day and I said, "It's okay, but I wouldn't have understood without your help." He shrugged like it was just this thing he did without any trouble and I suddenly found myself asking if he was going to the Homecoming dance in October.<br><br>"No way," he said. "That's for cheerleaders and jocks." As soon as he said it, he looked down at his feet to hide his embarrassment, but I could still see him grinning. "Sorry," he said. "I didn't mean you."<br><br>I shrugged like he'd shrugged off my compliment and told him not to include me with the rest of them. "I run," I said. "But I run for myself."<br><br>"I can respect that," said Jamie. Then he looked up and down the road as if he expected someone, and the last thing he said before he took the mail in was "I have to go to a Boy Scout meeting in a while, but give me a call sometime."<br><br>The next day his seat was empty, and two days later the whole town started looking for him. I joined in on the search, hoping I'd find him somewhere safe and sound, just hiding maybe, for whatever reason, but it was Gracie Highsmith, a girl in my class, who found his body two weeks later.<br><br>It was on that day, the day Gracie Highsmith found Jamie's body, that God's finger descended on my family. It was October. The reaping season, my grandma called it. For days the sky was black with storms, but no rain had fallen.<br><br>When I look back now, I don't know why I hadn't seen it coming. I saw things the same way as my grandma, and having that should have been enough to know what was coming. I could count crows, I knew the difference between dreaming and seeing the future, and I always took a different route than the one I'd been on if for some reason I had to turn around and go home. I knew that when a sparrow sang, a spirit was coming down from heaven. And I knew that ghosts always surround us, whether we're able to see them or not. "Don't talk to them too much," my grandma always warned me. "They can be nice, but in the end they're always jealous creatures."<br><br>So when all of this started--when my family was picked for sadness--I was sitting in my bedroom, playing a video game called Nevermorrow. I played a character who was a knight with a sword and shield. He was trapped in the nine layers of hell and had to kill all sorts of undead monsters to find his way out to the land of the living. While I hacked skeletons to pieces, my parents were out in the living room, yelling at each other.<br><br>It didn't really mean anything to me then--my parents had been fighting about one thing or another since I could remember. Usually it was about money or who did more or who was smarter. Sometimes my dad would lose his job and when that happened my mom and he would scream their fool heads off. His excuse was that construction work was seasonal, but there were other men my mother could name without pausing who never got laid off.<br><br>My dad was a drinking man, and sometimes my mom was a drinker too. Usually my dad drank when he lost work, then he and my mom would fight, and then she'd start drinking and they'd fight even worse. They'd eventually give up after a while, and things would return to normal, or as close to normal as we could get. My brother and I never got into the arguments. We figured it was grown-up stuff and that it'd all be fine in the end. But that day, my father told my mother she was a waste. And that's when the second bad thing began to come into being.<br><br>My dad said, "You are such a waste, Linda."<br><br>And my mom said, "Oh yeah? You think so? Well, we'll just see about that."<br><br>Then she got into her car and pulled out of our driveway, throwing gravel in every direction as she pushed down on the gas. She was going to Abel's, or so she said, where she would have a beer and find herself a real man.<br><br>When I look back on it now, I can see the holes they were making. I can see how, with each nasty thing they said, they were attracting misfortune, making doorways for darkness to come into our lives. So when the second bad thing arrived, it shouldn't have been a surprise, but at the time I didn't understand how it could have happened.</p><h2>Hawkmoon: The History of the Runestaff</h2><p>The earth has grown old, her landscapes mellow, her people lost in a brooding dream.

The author of many literary novels and stories in practically every genre, his novels have won and been shortlisted for numerous awards including the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Whitbread and Guardian Fiction Prize. In 1999, he was given the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award; in 2001, he was inducted into the SF Hall of Fame; and in 2007, he was named a SFWA Grandmaster. Michael Moorcock is also a musician who has performed since the seventies with his own band, the Deep Fix; and, as a member of the prog rock band, Hawkwind, won a gold disc. His tenure as editor of New Worlds magazine in the sixties and seventies is seen as the high watermark of SF editorship in the UK, and was crucial in the development of the SF New Wave. Michael Moorcock&#39;s literary creations include Hawkmoon, Corum, Von Bek, Jerry Cornelius and, of course, his most famous character, Elric. He has been compared to, among others, Balzac, Dumas, Dickens, James Joyce, Ian Fleming, J.R.R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard.

It is often wrongly assumed that the Jacobite rebellions were a contest between England and Scotland. In fact many Lowland Scots share the feelings of the English, and had cause to hate and fear their fellow countrymen in the Highlands. Thus it was to the Highland clans that the Jacobites looked to for their most reliable manpower. In this book Michael Barthorp details the events of the Jacobite rebellions, and the organisation and uniforms of the forces of both sides.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.Michael Barthorp was educated at Wellington College and was commissioned into the Rifle Brigade in 1946. Demobilized in 1948, he served as a Territorial with The Royal Hampshire Regiment before rejoining the Regular Army in The Northamptonshire Regiment to continue a family tradition, ending his career with the Royal Anglian Regiment in 1968. He published numerous books on the British Army history and costume, including nine titles for the Men-at-Arms series. He lived in Jersey, Channel Islands.</p><h2>The Umbrella Queen</h2><p><p>When Noot is finally allowed to paint umbrellas like the other women and girls in her village, she secretly hopes that she might be chosen as this year's Umbrella Queen. Carefully, she creates serene flowers and butterflies exactly as she has seen her mother and grandmother do for years.</p><p>But soon her imagination takes over, and Noot finds herself straying from the old patterns, to the dismay of her family, who depend on the traditionally painted umbrellas for their livelihood.</p><p>Her parents tell her she must go back to the old designs and Noot obeys, knowing that the King is coming soon to name the one who has painted the most beautiful umbrella. After all, the King would never choose a queen who breaks from tradition . . . would he?</p></p><p><p>Shirin Yim Bridges's first picture book, <em>Ruby's Wish</em>, won the Ezra Jack Keats Award and is on several state reading lists.

She lives in New York City.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2014;In a village high in the hills of Thailand, the people make umbrellas decorated with flowers and butterflies. Finally allowed to paint one, young Noot quickly demonstrates her talent to copy her mother's example, but when she's left on her own, she fills her umbrellas with fanciful elephants having fun and "being silly" instead of the expected designs. Her parents remind her that they earn their income by selling the traditional flower-and-butterfly umbrellas, and she knows that she must follow her mother's directions. But late at night, Noot continues to depict elephants on doll-size umbrellas, proudly arranging them on the windowsill. When the King arrives to choose this year's Umbrella Queen, the woman who has created the most beautiful design, he notices the miniatures and bestows the title upon Noot, because she "paints from her heart." Yoo's orange, green, and black colored linoleum prints wonderfully establish the tone for the story, which is related through gracefully told text. The delicately detailed images convey the characters' expressions as well as the loveliness of their creations.

Rumors abound as to its whereabouts. Some historians claim it was destroyed with the rest of Japan&#x2019;s weapons. Others believe it is hidden somewhere. Theories about its location vary from intricate cave systems to monks protecting the blade in a shrine somewhere in the mountains. When Sean Wyatt and his longtime friend Tommy Schultz try to help a troubled Japanese woman, they find themselves right in the thick of a power struggle between some of the most dangerous gangsters in the world. Now Sean and company must race across Japan, unravel clues that were left decades before, and discover the true location of a blade made by the greatest sword maker of all time: Honjo Masamune.</p><p></p><h2>The Eye of Spirit: An Integral Vision for a World Gone Slightly Mad</h2><p>In this groundbreaking book, Ken Wilber uses his widely acknowledged "spectrum of consciousness" model to completely rewrite our approach to such important fields as psychology, spirituality, anthropology, cultural studies, art and literary theory, ecology, feminism, and planetary transformation. What would each of those fields look like if we wholeheartedly accepted the existence of not just body and mind but also soul and spirit? <br><br>In a stunning display of integrative embrace, Wilber weaves these various fragments together into a coherent and compelling vision for the modern and postmodern world.</p><p><p>Ken Wilber is the author of over twenty books. He is the founder of Integral Institute, a think-tank for studying integral theory and practice, with outreach through local and online communities such as Integral Education Network, Integral Training, and Integral Spiritual Center.</p>Wilber (Sex, Ecology, Spirituality, Shambhala, 1995) takes on a tremendous task: attempting to derive from the tenets of the world's wisdom traditions, both religious and nonreligious, and from many academic fields one unifying vision of the modern and postmodern world. He calls his approach the "spectrum of consciousness," i.e., reducing aphorisms from various sources until they "agree" with each other, and using these as building blocks for his conclusions. Unfortunately, the long and difficult road Wilber takes us along leads to no grand religious or philosophical epiphany. The conclusions are a wash of poetic statements about an "ever-present awareness" or "a pure and simple witness," beliefs that are popular with New Age philosophies that require little of the deep discussions that preceded.

Being from another planet, he was naturally intrigued by everything earthly &#x2014; especially music, because music is the one thing on Earth most like the stars. Earthlings themselves confused Sun Ra, the way they sorted themselves by color and fought wars against one another. So he made music. And he traveled with other musicians and singers, calling themselves the Sun Ra Arkestra, playing, singing, and dancing for people all over the planet. Because music, he said, is what holds us all together.

The Person and His Work</h2><p>Highly acclaimed as the most reliable, thorough, and accessible introduction to Thomas Aquinas, this first volume in Jean-Pierre Torrell's set of books on the great Dominican theologian has been revised to include a new appendix. The appendix consists of additions to the text, the catalog of Aquinas's works, and the chronology. Each item in the appendix is called out in the original part of the book with an asterisk in the margin. <br><br>"This is the introduction to Thomas: presenting all the known facts of his life and work, tracing the themes of his writing out of his juvenilia, and following the influence of his thought in the years immediately after his death."&#x2015;<i>First Things</i><br><br>"The most up-to-date biography available."&#x2015;<i>Choice</i><p></p></p><p>First published in 1993 as Initiation saint Thomas d'Aquin: Sa personne et son oeuvre, this volume offers a thorough introduction to the life and works of Thomas Aquinas as well as a sustained reflection on the spiritual aspects of his life and teaching. For many readers, this English translation may well take the place of James Weisheipl's study, Friar Thomas D'Aquino. Broader in scope than Weisheipl, with greater emphasis on Thomas's personality and spirituality, this work also takes advantage of the research into Aquinas's life and times that has occurred in the twenty years since Weisheipl's book first appeared. Jean-Pierre Torrell reviews, clarifies, and frequently modifies previous scholarly conclusions on Aquinas's life and works. He presents the person of Thomas Aquinas in his complete familial, social, and intellectual context, summarizes the known events and circumstances of Aquinas's life, discusses the contents of his works, and provides a catalog of those works in an appendix. The last months of Aquinas's life and his death receive a fresh review based on careful examination of many witnesses about the events, about his relations with his family, and about his personal holiness. Thomas's daring originality is brought out clearly in the final two chapters, which describe the controversies in the years immediately after his death, the condemnations and rehabilitation of a few of his positions, and the process leading to canonization. This volume is the first of two on Thomas Aquinas to be written by Torrell. The second, which explores further the spiritual aspects of Aquinas's teaching, is completed in French and awaits translation into English. <p>On the French edition: "[A] magnificent achievement. . . . It will be an indispensable tool for every student of Thomas Aquinas."--The Thomist </p><p>"Torrell's book is the crown of recent research into Aquinas. Coming in the 1990s, it shows how greatly the 20th century has expanded the knowledge of Aquinas's thought and medieval milieu. . . . With painstaking scholarship [Torrell] offers his own opinions on hundreds of technical problems of biography, chronology, and of the context and purpose for all the writings. He devotes more time to Aquinas's theology and to Aquinas's life in the midst of a religious world than did Weisheipl. . . . It is clear that this book is the result of decades of careful reading and annotation; . . . it is the work of a scholar who is interested in meticulous discussions over chronology but also in the human side of Aquinas's years of intense labor."--Theological Studies </p><p>Jean-Pierre Torrell is a Dominican priest of the Toulouse province.

Despite overwhelming obstacles&#x2014;both in Europe and in the United States&#x2014;Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus made a bold and unprecedented decision to travel into Nazi Germany in an effort to save a group of Jewish children. <em>This is their story.</em></p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2014:</strong> If you missed the highly praised HBO documentary <em>50 Children</em>, you can get the whole story from this excellent chronicle by journalist Steven Pressman, who also wrote, directed, and produced the film. Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus were typical members of an affluent, educated Jewish community in Philadelphia in the 1930s; Gilbert was a lawyer, and Eleanor a bit of a shopaholic. Worried about what they were hearing from Europe by 1939, the Krauses set out to travel to Austria and Germany to save Jewish children from the advancing Nazis; they were not particularly religious or political and this was not an easy task in an era plagued by anti-Semitism and isolationism. But through careful readings of the law, loopholes in the visa-granting system, and plain old bravery, the Krauses managed to bring more than four dozen children to safety in the United States. Pressman, the Krauses&#x2019; grandson-in-law, used Eleanor Kraus&#x2019;s unpublished diaries as well as photographs, documents, and interviews to recreate a historical moment and a heroic act. Like Oskar Schindler and his list, the Krauses and their 50 children will now never be forgotten. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p><p>Steven Pressman was a magazine and newspaper journalist for more than thirty years.

With each story Means pushes into new territory, writing with tenderness and compassion about fatherhood, marriage, a homeless brother, the nature of addiction, and the death of a friend at the hands of a serial-killer nurse. Means transmutes a fistfight in Sacramento into a tender, life-long love story; two FBI agents on a stakeout in the 1920s into a tale of predator and prey, paternal urges and loss; a man&#x2019;s funeral instructions into a chronicle of organized crime, real estate ventures, and the destructive force of paranoia.</p><p>Means&#x2019;s work has earned him comparisons to Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, Alice Munro, Sherwood Anderson, Denis Johnson, Edgar Allan Poe, Anton Chekhov, and Raymond Carver but his place in the American literary landscape is fully and originally his own.</p><p><b>"David Means is a master of tense, distilled, quintessentially American prose.

Campbell Thompson London, June 1st, 1903. From the earliest times Eastern races, in common with the rest of mankind, have always held a firm belief in the existence of evil spirits, ghosts, and all kindred powers. The phenomenon of death, the mystery of disease and sickness, and all the other events of common occurrence in daily life gave rise to speculations about the unseen world, which gradually led to a distinction, although slight at all times, between good and evil spirits. The early Semitic people of Babylonia, whoever they may have been or wherever they may have migrated from, found a theology ready to their hands in the adopted country, which they took over from.... Even the Babylonians knew that they needed protection against the evil that existed, and sought their answers in the secrets that remained, them remannts of the story of Eden... It is therefore evident that when the Semitic Babylonian took over the learning of his Sumerian predecessors, he seems also to have unconsciously adapted an enlarged his ideas to fit their beliefs, receiving their doctrines in their entirety as worthy of implicit trust, and in the belief that his teachers must necessarily understand the supernatural powers peculiar to their own country. You will learn about: Various types of evil spirits and their classifications and purposes: where they dwell and where they came from- their origin. The truth about seven key evil spirits described in Luke 11:26 when he said, seven other spirits more evil than himself... How babyloinians used charms and magic to seek success and further their sorcery. Discover how secrets that were carried out from the Garden of Eden became key ingredients that Babylonians used in their sorcery. Babylonian cantantions that were to repell spirits. Secrets of the Babylonian tablets. Demons, Schools, Vampires, Hobgoblins, Ghosts, and Kindred Evil Spirits, which Attack Mankind Original goal of this book was to supply the student of Assyrian Demonology with English transliterations and translations, with the necessary notes, etc., of the documents printed in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Parts of Cuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets, etc., which have been recently issued by the Trustees of the British Museum. It includes proof of the fact that a considerable proportion of the magical practices which are in use in the East to the present day were well known to the inhabitants of Mesopotamia several thousands of years ago, and that many of them were borrowed by the Hebrews and other dwellers in Syria and Persia from their neighbors on that Tigris and Euphrates.</p><p>Text: English (translation)</p><h2>Windows to the Womb: Revealing the Conscious Baby from Conception to Birth</h2><p><i>Windows to the Womb</i> is an eloquent guide through the first nine months of life from conception to birth. In the past, the invisible physical processes of fetal development were mysterious and largely unexplainable, but in the past half-century, breakthroughs in embryology, interuterine photography, ultrasound, and other sensitive instruments of measurement have enabled us to make systematic observations inside the womb. We now understand that fetuses are fully sentient and aware beings. In this new climate of appreciation for the surprising dimensions of fetal behavior, sensitivity, and intelligence, this book brings a host of new information to light about the transformative journey each one of us must undergo in the womb.<br><br>With reverent awe, the author describes the amazing construction of our physical bodies, the "ultimate architecture," and draws parallels with the expansion of our minds as our brains and senses develop and grow. Dr. Chamberlain details new discoveries in embryonic and fetal research that support his own findings on the impact of the mother's emotional and physical state during pregnancy; the importance of bonding at the earliest stages, long before birth; and the steps that expectant parents can take to ensure the most nurturing start in life for their children.</p><p>David Chamberlain, PhD, is a California psychologist, scholar, author, and international lecturer with over 60 publications and 27 years of leadership in the Association for Prenatal and Perinatal Psychology and Health (APPPAH). In a landmark study of mother and child pairs in 1980, he demonstrated that birth memories were reliable and not fantasies. In 2003, <i>Mothering</i> magazine celebrated David as a "Living Treasure." He was a founding faculty member of Santa Barbara Graduate Institute; in 2006 the institute conferred upon him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree. In 2007, he was honored at the Gentle Birth World Conference with the Mother Goose Award for his work with mothers and babies. The author lives in Nevada City, CA.&nbsp;<br><b>Interactive, Social Movement in the Womb</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Although traditional psychological theory looked for the beginnings of social behavior long after birth, you may already realize how intimate and relational your life inside mother really is. Can a human being ever be closer than this&#x2014;woven into her body, your lifelines linked, tucked under her variable heartbeat, memorizing her rising and falling vocal productions? How could you avoid something so close? You live in layered space, not in solitude. Your mother breaks into song! Or tears. Happily or unhappily, she moves through space and you move right along with her. The womb is not an isolation tank. <br>&nbsp;<br>In the course of growing, you encounter more and more of her richness and rhythm, first the inside sounds, then the blend of sounds outside of her including the recurring sounds of other voices nearby like your father, siblings, or household pets, voices directed toward you. Noises from farther out eventually add to the impersonal cacophony of the world of storms, traffic, sirens, or explosions. Babies don&#x2019;t ignore these provocations; they get curious and interested, and participate. They are social creatures. <br>&nbsp;<br>Mothers and fathers are social too: they have their own curiosity and start experimenting with how to communicate with you a few layers down. They may blurt things out spontaneously in their usual adult language, although if they stop to think about it, they tell themselves this is a little crazy because you haven&#x2019;t yet had time to learn any language. At certain times of day they may sing to you or read stories&#x2014;something slightly less crazy, but possibly entertaining. Dads think up their own weird experiments. One dad used to announce from time to time in a commanding voice, &#x201c;This is your father speaking!&#x201d; With repetition it started to mean something. When he made that statement at birth, the baby immediately turned his head and searched for that voice. They were continuing a relationship established long before birth. <br>&nbsp;<br>Parents using the prenatal enrichment program created by obstetrician F. Rene Van de Carr like learning how to play the kick game. First they have to notice that you have started to kick somewhere. When that is happening, they touch the abdomen where you are already kicking and say, &#x201c;Kick, baby, kick!&#x201d; Babies catch on, and the game progresses as baby kicks in new places being touched. Some parents have even discovered that if they touch in a circle pattern, babies soon learn to kick in a circle! Of course the whole purpose of this is to play together and be social&#x2014;all within the natural abilities of the baby in the womb. <br>&nbsp;<br>Van de Carr reports an examination he was doing under ultrasound, as Beethoven&#x2019;s Fifth Symphony was playing in the background. He observed that the thirty-three-week-old baby was breathing in time with the music. When he stopped the music, the breathing pattern stopped as well. When the music started again, breathing started again, but not in time with the beat. However, after skipping a breath, the baby was again back in cadence with the music. <br>&nbsp;<br>A colleague of mine, by profession a doctor and by hobby a folksinger, often entertained her baby during pregnancy by singing folk songs. She noticed the baby kicked a lot when she hit the low notes, so she would deliberately invent more low notes. Mother and baby were having a relationship, no doubt of that, but it was not the one she assumed. Clarification came about three years after birth when the baby boy finally had words to explain that he was kicking because he did not like hearing those low notes! <br>&nbsp;<br>Consider the heretofore &#x201c;secret&#x201d; life of twins. With the help of ultrasound, we have learned some of the unforeseen dimensions of their intimate life with each other. In 1996, perinatologist Birgit Arabin and colleagues in the Netherlands discovered just how, when, and where twins first touched each other. By systematically observing twenty-five sets of twins at weekly intervals, they found first touches and reactions at seven weeks from conception. Brief contacts of less than three seconds went to an arm, leg, head, or torso. Initial approaches were slow but became faster with practice. Over the next three weeks touch became longer and more complex between their bodies and extremities. In another week came contacts initiated by sucking movements&#x2014;all this development in a window of twenty-seven days. Arabin watched as lips met lips and recognized it as a kiss. <br>&nbsp;<br>Experts around the world who have an opportunity to observe lots of twins report seeing them hitting and kicking each other; some were &#x201c;boxing,&#x201d; trading blows back and forth with a pause between. Alessandra Piontelli in Milan has written in painstaking detail about her ultrasound observations of a series of singletons and twins beginning in 1987. Her purpose was to see if there was a continuum of human behavior between the prenatal period and infancy&#x2014;something she proved with great success in a series of publications. Starting about halfway through gestation, she concentrated on monthly hour-long recording sessions and after birth followed the babies annually for several years. She discovered a hidden world of complex fetal behavior clearly revealing a variety of personalities and relationships previously unknown in psychology. <br>&nbsp;<br>Twins Marisa and Beatrice hit each other in the womb and continued to do so after birth! Celia and Mark also had a conflicted relationship. Celia was so much in motion that both parents said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope she will calm down after birth.&#x201d; Her brother, more restless than active, kept turning and folding his legs tightly while screening his face with his hands. He responded to any stimulation coming from his sister by turning away and burying his face deeply inside a distant corner of the placenta. If she persisted in trying to make contact with him using rather gentle motions of her feet and hands, he responded by violently kicking back. She instantly withdrew as if frightened by his strength. At birth, Mark&#x2019;s mother described his facial expression saying &#x201c;his forehead is permanently corrugated; somehow he looks permanently tired and old.&#x201d; At three months of age, when Celia tried to touch him, he always reacted by turning away. At eight months, he was still pushing away his sister&#x2019;s advances, and mother testified he &#x201c;often knocked her out!&#x201d; I cannot think of a more obvious example of the organic relationship between motion and emotion. <br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, lest you form the impression that all twins are aggressive and angry in utero, Piontelli shares with us the charmed relationship of Luke and Alicia. When first observed at the halfway point in pregnancy, in spite of obvious differences in size and agility, the two were a friendly pair. Luke, agile and active in testing out his leg muscles on the uterine wall� would periodically turn his attention to his sister. Reaching out gently with his hands to the dividing membrane that separated them, he touched her face, and when she responded by turning her face toward him, he engaged with her in stroking, cheek-to-cheek motions. From this time, the mother and doctor nicknamed them &#x201c;the kind twins.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>During the following monthly observations, the kind behavior continued. Alicia was always in a more sleepy and passive role, and Luke, smaller but more active, paused in his exercises to approach his sister by touching her face, after which they engaged in a mutual face-to-face stroking. At one point the mother remarked on how &#x201c;they seem to cuddle up together.... Look how he strokes her.&#x201d; After birth this agreeable behavior continued with Luke in the initiative, smiling, seeking interaction with his father and mother, as well as his sister. He seemed interested in everything, including music, the piano, and looking into picture books. He was the first to walk and talk and his parents commented on the &#x201c;adult quality&#x201d; of his eye-to-eye contact with them and with his sister. <br>&nbsp;<br>At one year of age both could walk and were beginning to talk; they showed great delight in playing with each other. Mother reaffirmed that they were still kind to each other and touched each other to express their fondness. She reported that their favorite game had become hiding on opposite sides of a curtain and using it like the dividing membrane in utero. Luke would put forward his hand through the curtain and Alicia reached out with her head and their mutual stroking began, accompanied by gurgles and smiles&#x2014;just as they did in the womb. <br>&nbsp;<br>American psychologist Evelyn Thoman studied premature babies who were in the same age bracket as babies still enclosed in the womb, further documenting the social nature of interactions inside and outside the womb, and the organic relationship of motion and emotion as well. Thoman invented a toy teddy bear that could be set to breathe at a rate to match that of each premature baby during quiet sleep. In an experimental format where some babies had a Breathing Bear, some a nonbreathing bear, and some no bear at all, sleeping babies in these three conditions acted very differently. After three weeks the records showed that infants with breathing bears made significantly more contact with their head, body, arms, or legs than the other sleepers. Showing interest in the presence of a breathing &#x201c;companion,&#x201d; they moved steadily toward it and interacted with it&#x2014;I dare say happily. And the experiment showed another significant result. Babies with bears set to breathe at their own rate of quiet sleep ended up spending greater amounts of time in quiet sleep. Were they not intimately engaged with and being influenced by the companion teddy? <br>&nbsp;<br>In more complex studies with the Breathing Bear as a &#x201c;rhythmic stimulation&#x201d; in sleep, babies at thirty-three to thirty-five weeks of conceptional age showed less wakefulness, more quiet sleep, fewer startles in quiet sleep, and less crying. In active sleep (REM), babies with the Breathing Bears were more likely to smile (positive affect) while those with nonbreathing bears were more likely to grimace (negative affect). Researchers concluded that the presence of a breathing bear facilitated neurobehavioral organization. Because premature babies have left the womb early and no longer have close proximity to their mother&#x2019;s stimulating rhythms, sounds, and movements, there are reasons to think they would appreciate even a small reminder of mother while sleeping in a hospital Isolette. <br>&nbsp;<br>Finally the story of twins Kyrie and Brielle, born twelve weeks before term, reveals not only the keen social attunement they developed in utero but the grave danger of losing it during a crisis in the premature nursery. In addition they dramatize how eloquent body language can be and how powerfully motion and emotion work in sync. At birth Kyrie weighed two pounds and three ounces, while Brielle weighed just two pounds. In their first month of neonatal intensive care, the gap widened as the larger quickly gained weight and slept calmly. Brielle had breathing problems, heart rate problems, and lower oxygen levels in her blood. She began gasping for breath and her face and stick-thin arms and legs turned bluish-gray. Her parents were terrified she might die. <br>&nbsp;<br>The nurse tried everything: suctioning the breathing passages and turning up the oxygen flow but the heart rate continued soaring. Desperate she recalled being told that in Europe, multiples (especially pre-matures) were sometimes &#x201c;double-bedded.&#x201d; After getting the parents&#x2019; permission, she put the sisters together. No sooner had the door of the incubator closed, than the weak one snuggled up to Kyrie and calmed right down. Within minutes her oxygen readings were the best they had been since she was born. As the smaller one dozed, Kyrie wrapped her tiny arm around Brielle. Happily a photo recorded the precious moment, which is how millions of us around the world became aware of this miracle among twins. From that lifesaving moment of reunion, Brielle left the danger zone and started on the road to health. <br>&nbsp;<br><b><i>An excerpt from </i>Windows to the Womb<i> by David Chamberlain, published by North Atlantic Books, copyright � 2013 by David Chamberlain.

At its center is a neglected treasure of the late Renaissance: the <i>Four Elements</i> manuscripts of Joris Hoefnagel (1542&#x2013;1600), a learned Netherlandish merchant, miniaturist, and itinerant draftsman who turned to the study of nature in this era of political and spiritual upheaval. Presented here for the first time are more than eighty pages in color facsimile of Hoefnagel&#x2019;s encyclopedic masterwork, which showcase both the splendor and eccentricity of its meticulously painted animals, insects, and botanical specimens.</p><p>Marisa Anne Bass unfolds the circumstances that drove the creation of the <i>Four Elements</i> by delving into Hoefnagel&#x2019;s writings and larger oeuvre, the works of his friends, and the rich world of classical learning and empirical inquiry in which he participated. Bass reveals how Hoefnagel and his colleagues engaged with natural philosophy as a means to reflect on their experiences of war and exile, and found refuge from the threats of iconoclasm and inquisition in the manuscript medium itself. This is a book about how destruction and violence can lead to cultural renewal, and about the transformation of Netherlandish identity on the eve of the Dutch Golden Age.</p></p><p>A study of a remarkable Flemish painter and miniaturist, focusing on how his natural history illustrations reflect the political and economic turmoil of his era.<b>Marisa Anne Bass</b> is associate professor of the history of art at Yale University.

Elaine Mar and her mother emigrated from Hong Kong to Denver to join her father in a community more Chinese than American, more hungry than hopeful. </p> <p> While working with her family in the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant and living in the basement of her aunt's house, Mar quickly masters English and begins to excel in school. But as her home and school life--Chinese tradition and American independence--become two increasingly disparate worlds, Mar tries desperately to navigate between them.</p><p> Adolescence and the awakening of her sexuality leave Elaine isolated and confused. She yearns for storebought clothes and falls for a red-haired boy who leads her away from the fretful eyes of her family. In his presence, Elaine is overcome by the strength of her desire--blocking out her family's visions of an arranged marriage in Hong Kong. </p><p> From surviving racist harassment in the schooIyard to trying to flip her straight hair like Farrah Fawcett, from hiding her parents' heritage to arriving alone at Harvard University, Mar's story is at once an unforgettable personal journey and an unflinching, brutal look at the realities of the American Dream.</p></p><p>Born in Hong Kong to parents who immigrated there from the Toishan region of mainland China, Elaine Mar came to America in 1972, when she was not quite 6. Colorado was quite a shock to a girl who had previously shared a five-room apartment with four other families. "She must be rich," Man Yee (her Chinese name) thought, emerging from the basement room where she and her parents slept to explore her Aunt Becky's three-bedroom house in a working-class Denver neighborhood. Not so: her aunt, father, and other relatives worked in the kitchen of a restaurant owned by others, and Mar's pungent memoir of her odyssey from poor immigrant to Harvard undergraduate shatters stereotypes about Asians as the "model minority." She was a smart girl and a good student who soon preferred the American name Elaine and "only spoke Chinese when absolutely necessary," but she found it hard to decipher the "cultural cues" on which social success in school depended. Honestly chronicling conflicts with her parents, whose horizons and expectations seemed unbearably limited, Mar outlines her youthful rebellion and their response with mature understanding. Her observation of American life is as clear-eyed and unsentimental as her self-portrait of a girl adrift between two cultures. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>With gritty, intimate detail, M. Elaine Mar takes us into the back rooms of a Chinese restaurant and the upper floors of an immigrants&#39; social club, places whose addresses say &#34;Denver&#34; but whose interiors speak of another country. By revealing this little-seen, insular pocket of America, Mar debunks the notion of a classless, integrated society. Her portrait of childhood inside a struggling ethnic enclave challenges the stereotype of Asian Americans as a &#34;model minority&#34; highlighting instead the barriers to success that exist in every American ghetto, from Chinatown to Harlem to Appalachia. In her unforgettable journey from enduring racial harassment on the playground to graduating from Harvard, Mar tackles the larger issues of class and ethnicity with wit and intelligence.</p><h2>Contending with Christianity&#39;s Critics: Answering New Atheists and Other Objectors</h2><p><p></p><p><b><i>Contending with Christianity&#x2019;s Critics </i></b>is book two in a series on modern Christian apologetics that began with the popular <b><i>Passionate Conviction</i></b>.

Startled by shouts of &#x201c;Lai day, lai day&#x201d; (&#x201c;Come here, come here&#x201d;), the three men dropped their packs and fled. The company commander, a young lieutenant, sent a platoon down the trail to investigate. Those few men soon found themselves outnumbered, surrounded, and fighting for their lives. Their first desperate moments marked the beginning of a series of bloody battles that lasted more than a week, one that survivors would later call &#x201c;the nine days in May border battles.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Nine Days in May </i>is the first full account of these bitterly contested battles. Part of Operation Francis Marion, they took place in the Ia Tchar Valley and the remote jungle west of Pleiku.

What will the sky be saying?<br>Personally, I like a chocolate-colored sky. Dark, dark chocolate. People say it suits me. I do, however, try to enjoy every color I see--the whole spectrum. A billion or so flavors, none of them quite the same, and a sky to slowly suck on. It takes the edge off the stress. It helps me relax.<br>***A SMALL THEORY&nbsp; ***<br>People observe the colors of a day only at its beginnings and ends, but to me it's quite clear that a day merges through a multitude of shades and intonations, with each passing moment. <br>A single hour can consist of thousands of different colors. <br>Waxy yellows, cloud-spat blues. Murky darknesses. <br>In my line of work, I make it a point to notice them.<br>As I've been alluding to, my one saving grace is distraction. It keeps me sane. It helps me cope, considering the length of time I've been performing this job. The trouble is, who could ever replace me? Who could step in while I take a break in your stock-standard resort-style vacation destination, whether it be tropical or of the ski trip variety? The answer, of course, is nobody, which has prompted me to make a conscious, deliberate decision--to make distraction my vacation. Needless to say, I vacation in increments. In colors.<br>Still, it's possible that you might be asking, why does he even need a vacation? What does he need distraction from?<br>Which brings me to my next point.<br>It's the leftover humans.<br>The survivors.<br>They're the ones I can't stand to look at, although on many occasions I still fail. I deliberately seek out the colors to keep my mind off them, but now and then, I witness the ones who are left behind, crumbling among the jigsaw puzzle of realization, despair, and surprise. They have punctured hearts. They have beaten lungs.<br>Which in turn brings me to the subject I am telling you about tonight, or today, or whatever the hour and color. It's the story of one of those perpetual survivors--an expert at being left behind.<br>It's just a small story really, about, among other things:<br>* A girl<br>* Some words<br>* An accordionist<br>* Some fanatical Germans<br>* A Jewish fist fighter<br>* And quite a lot of thievery<br>I saw the book thief three times.<br>BESIDE THE RAILWAY LINE<br>First up is something white. Of the blinding kind.<br>Some of you are most likely thinking that white is not really a color and all of that tired sort of nonsense. Well, I'm here to tell you that it is. White is without question a color, and personally, I don't think you want to argue with me.<br>***A REASSURING ANNOUNCEMENT&nbsp; ***<br>Please, be calm, despite that previous threat.<br>I am all bluster--<br>I am not violent. <br>I am not malicious.<br>I am a result.<br>Yes, it was white.<br>It felt as though the whole globe was dressed in snow. Like it had pulled it on, the way you pull on a sweater. Next to the train line, footprints were sunken to their shins. Trees wore blankets of ice.<br>As you might expect, someone had died.<br>They couldn't just leave him on the ground. For now, it wasn't such a problem, but very soon, the track ahead would be cleared and the train would need to move on.<br>There were two guards.<br>There was one mother and her daughter.<br>One corpse.<br>The mother, the girl, and the corpse remained stubborn and silent.<br>"Well, what else do you want me to do?"<br>The guards were tall and short. The tall one always spoke first, though he was not in charge. He looked at the smaller, rounder one. The one with the juicy red face.<br>"Well," was the response, "we can't just leave them like this, can we?"<br>The tall one was losing patience. "Why not?"<br>And the smaller one damn near exploded. He looked up at the tall one's chin and cried, "Spinnst du! Are you stupid?!" The abhorrence on his cheeks was growing thicker by the moment. His skin widened. "Come on," he said, traipsing over the snow. "We'll carry all three of them back on if we have to. We'll notify the next stop."<br>As for me, I had already made the most elementary of mistakes. I can't explain to you the severity of my self-disappointment. Originally, I'd done everything right:<br>I studied the blinding, white-snow sky who stood at the window of the moving train. I practically inhaled it, but still, I wavered. I buckled--I became interested. In the girl. Curiosity got the better of me, and I resigned myself to stay as long as my schedule allowed, and I watched.<br>Twenty-three minutes later, when the train was stopped, I climbed out with them.<br>A small soul was in my arms.<br>I stood a little to the right.<br>The dynamic train guard duo made their way back to the mother, the girl, and the small male corpse. I clearly remember that my breath was loud that day. I'm surprised the guards didn't notice me as they walked by. The world was sagging now, under the weight of all that snow.<br>Perhaps ten meters to my left, the pale, empty-stomached girl was standing, frost-stricken.<br>Her mouth jittered.<br>Her cold arms were folded.<br>Tears were frozen to the book thief's face.</p><h2>2084: The End of the World</h2><p>A tribute to George Orwell's <i>1984</i> and a cry of protest against totalitarianism of all kinds, Sansal's <i>2084</i> tells the story of a near future in which religious extremists have established an oppressive caliphate where autonomous thought is forbidden.<b><br></b><br>It is the year 2084. In the kingdom of Abistan&#x2014;named after the prophet Abi, earthly messenger of the god Yolah&#x2014;citizens submit to a single god, demonstrating their devotion by kneeling in prayer nine times a day. Autonomous thought has been banned, remembering is forbidden, and an omnipresent surveillance system instantly informs the authorities of every deviant act, thought, or idea. The kingdom is blessed and its citizens are happy, filled with a sense of purpose and piety. Those who are not&#x2014;the heretics&#x2014;are put to death by stoning or beheading in city squares. But Ati has met people who think differently; in ghettos and caves, hidden from the authorities, exist the last living heretics and free-thinkers of Abistan. Under their influence, Ati begins to doubt. He begins to think. Now, he will have to defend his thoughts with his life.&nbsp;<br><br>"[In <i>2084</i>] Sansal dared to go much further than I did," said Michel Houellebecq, the controversial novelist most recently of <i>Submission</i>. <i>2084 </i>is a cry of freedom, a call to rebellion, a gripping satirical novel of ideas, and an indictment of the religious fundamentalism that, with its hypocrisy and closed-mindedness, threatens our modern democracies and the ideals on which they are founded.<br><br><b>WINNER OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY GRAND PRIX</b></p><p><b>Boualem Sansal </b>is the Arab world&#x2019;s most courageous&nbsp;and controversial novelist.

How is it, Latymer wonders, that when one sense blunts another sharpens. He can pick up the scent of everything, the reek of ale on the man&#x2019;s breath, the yeasty whiff of bread baking in the kitchens below, the wet-dog stink of the spaniel curled up by the hearth. But he can see little, the room swims and the man is a vague dark shape leaning over the bed with a grimace of a smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Make your mark here, my lord,&#x201d; he says, enunciating as if talking to a child or an idiot.<br> <br>A waft of violets sweeps over him. It is Katherine&#x2014;his dear, dear Kit.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let me help you up, John,&#x201d; she is saying, as she shifts his body forward and slips a pillow behind him.<br> <br>She lifts him so easily. He must have wasted quite away these last months. It is no wonder with the lump in his gut, hard and round as a Spanish grapefruit. The movement starts something off, an excruciating wave that rises through his body forcing an inhuman groan from him.<br> <br>&#x201c;My love.&#x201d; Katherine strokes his forehead.<br> <br>Her touch is cool. The pain twists deeper into him. He can hear the clink of her preparing a tincture. The spoon flashes as it catches the light. The chill of metal touches his lips, and a trickle of liquid pools in his mouth. Its loamy scent brings back a distant memory of riding through woods and with it a sadness, for his riding days are over. His gullet feels too thick to swallow and he fears setting off the pain again. It has receded but hovers, as does the notary who shifts from one foot to the other in an embarrassed shuffle. Latymer wonders why the man is not more used to this kind of thing, given that wills are his living. Katherine strokes his throat and the tincture slides down. Soon it will take effect. His wife has a gift with remedies. He has thought about what kind of potion she could concoct to set him free from this useless carcass of his. She&#x2019;d know exactly what would do it. After all, any one of the plants she uses to deaden his pain could kill a man if the dose were right&#x2014;a little more of this or that and it would be done.<br> <br>But how can he ask that of her?<br> <br>A quill is placed between his fingers and his hand is guided to the papers so he can make his mark. His scrawl will make Katherine a woman of considerable means. He hopes it will not bring the curse of fortune hunters to her door. She is still young enough, just past thirty, and her charisma that made him&#x2014;already an elderly widower&#x2014;fall so deeply still hangs over her like a halo. She never had the ordinary beauty of other men&#x2019;s wives. No, her attraction is complicated and has blossomed with age. But Katherine is too sharp to be taken in by some silver-tongued charmer with his eye on a widow&#x2019;s fortune. He owes her too much. When he thinks of how she has suffered in his name, it makes him want to weep, but his body is incapable of even that.<br> <br>He has not left her Snape Castle, his Yorkshire seat; she wouldn&#x2019;t want it. She would be happy, she has said many times, if she were never to set foot in Snape again. Snape will go to Young John. Latymer&#x2019;s son did not turn out quite the man he&#x2019;d hoped and he has often wondered what kind of child he might have had with Katherine. But that thought is always shadowed with the memory of the dead baby, the damned infant that was made when the Catholic rebels ransacked Snape. He cannot bear to imagine how that baby came about, fathered by, of all people, Murgatroyd, whom he used to take out hunting hares as a boy. He was a sweet lad, showed no sign of the brute he would become. Latymer curses the day he left his young wife alone with his children to go to court and seek pardon from the King, curses the weakness that got him involved with the rebels in the first place. Six years have passed since, but the events of that time are carved into his family like words on a gravestone.<br> <br>Katherine is straightening the bedcovers, humming a tune; it&#x2019;s one he doesn&#x2019;t recognize, or can&#x2019;t remember. A surge of love rises in him. His marriage to her was a love match&#x2014;for him, anyway. But he hadn&#x2019;t done what husbands are supposed to do; he hadn&#x2019;t protected her. Katherine had never spoken of it. He&#x2019;d wanted her to scream and rage at him&#x2014;to hate him, blame him. But she remained poised and contained, as if nothing had changed. And her belly grew large, taunting him. Only when that baby came, and died within the hour, did he see the smudge of tears on her face. Yet still, nothing was ever said.<br> <br>This tumor, eating away at him slowly, is his punishment, and all he can do to atone is make her rich. How can he ask one more thing of her? If she could inhabit his wracked body even for an instant she would do his bidding without question. It would be an act of mercy, and there is no sin in that, surely.<br> <br>She is by the door, seeing the notary out, then she floats back to sit beside him, pulling her hood off and discarding it at the foot of the bed, rubbing her temples with the tips of her fingers and shaking out her Titian hair. Its dried-flower scent drifts over and he longs to bury his face in it as he used to do. Taking a book, she begins to read quietly, the Latin tripping easily off her tongue. It is Erasmus. His own Latin is too rusty to get the sense of it; he should remember this book but he doesn&#x2019;t. She was always better learned than him, though pretended otherwise, never one to blow her own bugle.<br> <br>A timid knock interrupts them. It is Meg holding the hand of that gawky maid, whose name escapes him. Poor little Meg who, since Murgatroyd and his men came, has been jumpy as a colt, which made him wonder what might have been done to her too. The little spaniel comes to life with a frenzied wagging and wriggling about the girls&#x2019; feet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Father,&#x201d; Meg whispers, placing a spring-meadow kiss on his forehead. &#x201c;How do you?&#x201d;<br> <br>He lifts his hand, a great dead lump of driftwood, placing it over her soft young one, and attempts a smile.<br> <br>She turns to Katherine, saying, &#x201c;Mother, Huicke is here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dot,&#x201d; Katherine says to the maid, &#x201c;will you see the doctor in.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, my lady.&#x201d; She turns with a swish of skirts, making for the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;And Dot&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; adds Katherine.<br> <br>The maid stops in the doorway.<br> <br>&#x201c;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ask one of the lads to bring more wood for the fire. We are down to the last log.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl bobs, nodding.<br> <br>&#x201c;It is Meg&#x2019;s birthday today, John,&#x201d; says Katherine. &#x201c;She is seventeen.&#x201d;<br> <br>He feels clogged up, wants to see her properly, read the expression in her nut-brown eyes, but the detail of her is blurred. &#x201c;My little Margaret Neville, a woman&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. seventeen.&#x201d; His voice is a croak. &#x201c;Someone will want to marry you. A fine young man.&#x201d; It strikes him like a slap in the face&#x2014;he will never know his daughter&#x2019;s husband.<br> <br>Meg&#x2019;s hand wipes at her eye.<br> <br>Huicke slips into the chamber. He has come each day this week. Latymer wonders why it is that the King sends one of his own physicians to care for an almost disgraced northern lord such as he. Katherine thinks it is a sign that he is truly pardoned. But it doesn&#x2019;t make sense and he knows the King enough to suspect that there is an ulterior purpose to this gesture; although what it is, he&#x2019;s not sure.<br> <br>The doctor is a thin black shadow approaching the bed. Meg takes her leave with another kiss. Huicke draws back the covers, allowing a rancid stench to escape, and begins to palpate the lump with butterfly fingers. Latymer hates those kid-clad hands. He has never known Huicke to remove his gloves, which are fine and buff like human skin. He wears a ring set with a garnet the size of an eye over them. Latymer loathes the man disproportionately for those gloves, the deceit of them pretending to be hands, and the way they make him feel unclean.<br> <br>Sharp bursts of pain peck at him, making his breath fast and shallow. Huicke sniffs at a phial of something&#x2014;his own piss, he supposes&#x2014;and holds it up to the light while talking quietly with Katherine. She glows in the proximity of this young doctor. He is too fey and girlish to be a threat at least, but Latymer hates him anew for his youth and his promise, not just for his gloved hands. He must be quite brilliant to be in the King&#x2019;s service and still so young. Huicke&#x2019;s future is laid out before him like a feast, while his own is all used up. Latymer drifts off, the hushed voices washing over him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have given him something new for the pain,&#x201d; she is saying. &#x201c;White-willow bark and motherwort.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You have a physician&#x2019;s touch,&#x201d; Huicke replies. &#x201c;I would not have thought to put those together.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am interested in herbals. I have a little physic garden of my own&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She pauses. &#x201c;I like to see things grow. And I have Bankes&#x2019;s book.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bankes&#x2019;s Herbal, that is the best of them. Well, I think so, but it is rather scorned by the academics.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose they think it a woman&#x2019;s book.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They do,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;And that is precisely what recommends it to me. In my opinion women know more about healing than all the scholars in Oxford and Cambridge together, though I generally keep that to myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>Latymer feels a bolt of pain shooting through him, sharper this time, folding him in half. He hears a scream, barely recognizing it as his own. He is dying of guilt. The spasm wanes eventually to a dull ache. Huicke has gone and he supposes he must have been asleep. He is struck then with a sudden overwhelming sense of urgency. He must ask her before speech deserts him, but how to phrase it?<br> <br>He grabs Katherine&#x2019;s wrist, surprised by his own strength, rasping, &#x201c;Give me more tincture.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I cannot, John,&#x201d; she replies. &#x201c;I have already given you the limit. More would&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Her words hang.<br> <br>He grasps her more tightly, growling, &#x201c;It is what I want, Kit.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looks at him, straight on, saying nothing.<br> <br>He thinks he can see her thoughts like the workings of a clock, wondering, he imagines, where in the Bible to find justification for this; how to reconcile her soul with such an act; that it could send her to the gallows; that if he were a pheasant got at by the dog, she would think nothing of a merciful twist of his neck.<br> <br>&#x201c;What you ask of me will damn us both,&#x201d; she whispers.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; he replies.</p><h2>The Capable Cruiser: Expanded and Revised</h2><p><i>The Capable Cruiser</i> is a logical extension of the Pardeys' <i>The Self-Sufficient Sailor</i> (978-0964603677), with more emphasis on seamanship underway, including careful analysis of extreme anchoring situations and solutions for mitigating them. Underlying each and every chapter is the warmth and encouragement that spurred Herb McCormick, former editor of "Cruising World" magazine, to label Lin and Larry Pardey "the enablers." This revised and expanded third edition of a cruising classic includes 10 completely new chapters with such advice as: 16 ways to encourage your lover (partner) to share your dream; strategies for turning sudden engine failure into a minor incident; choosing safety equipment and repairing rigging at sea. All of the original chapters have been updated to ensure that the information will be helpful for everyone who dreams of cruising-whether now or in the near future.</p><p>Lin and Larry Pardey have voyaged together for over 26 years, covering the equivalent of 5 circumnavigations on board their own self-built cutters, Seraffyn and Taleisin. Larry worked as first mate on a 140-ton, 85-foot schooner, Double Eagle, voyaging from Newport Beach, California, to Hawaii and back and along the Mexican coast before meeting Lin. He, along with Leslie Dyball, won the handicap prize for first overall in the exceptionally stormy 1974 Round Britain two-handed race. Lin and Larry have delivered two dozen boats across oceans and raced their own and others boats. Their interest in storm tactics has led them to research both older and modern methods of heaving-to, by talking and corresponding with sailors from dozens of countries, by working with Victor Shane at the Drag Device Data Base, and by testing both on their own boat in hurricane-force winds and on modern boats off the Cape of Storms, in South Africa. <p>Larry was selected as the winner of the International Oceanic Award, givenby the Royal Institute of Navigation under the sponsorship of the Little Ship Club of London and presented by Her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, Princess Anne, for the most meritorious voyage of over 2,000 miles using traditional methods of navigation. Larrys award was for 30 years of successful voyaging, covering more than 150,000 miles on 21 different vessels and using onlysextant and chronometer, including his 2,840 mile voyage in 1995 from Fernancdo do Noronha to Horta, in the Azores. </p><p>In March 1996, Lin was presented with the Ocean Cruising Club Award for the person who has done the most to foster and encourage ocean cruising in small craft and the practice of seamanship and navigation in all branches, at the Royal Thames Yacht Club, in London. </p><p>Articles by Lin and Larry have appeared in Sail Magazine, Cruising World, Woodenboat (USA) Practical Boat Owner, Yachting Monthly, Classic Boat Magazine (UK), Cruising Helmsman (Australia), South African Yachting, and Nautica (Brazil). </p><p>Their nine books have been published in both the United States and England; two have been translated into German and Japanese. Lin and Larry are currently writing a new book, <i>The Cost Conscious Cruiser</i>. Their most recent voyage took them to Scotland and Norway, and Taleisin is ready for another voyage, either west or north in the spring of 1998.</p>Lin and Larry have voyaged a distance equivalent to the length of circumnavigating the world seven times. With over 300,000 copies of their books on seamanship, adventuring and boat building in print, they may be the most recognized sailors alive today. They have presented seminars to more than 10,000 people in six countries.</p><h2>God Is Impassible and Impassioned</h2><p><p>Modern theologians have focused on the doctrine of divine impassibility, exploring the significance of God&#x2019;s emotional experience and most especially the question of divine suffering. Professor Rob Lister speaks into the issue, outlining the history of the doctrine in the views of influential figures such as Augustine, Aquinas, and Luther, while carefully examining modernity&#x2019;s growing rejection of impassibility and the subsequent evangelical response. With an eye toward holistic synthesis, this book proposes a theological model based upon fresh insights into the historical, biblical, and theological dimensions of this important doctrine.</p></p><p><p><strong>Rob Lister</strong>&nbsp;(PhD, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) is associate professor of biblical and theological studies at the Talbot School of Theology. His primary research interests include theology proper, christology, and sanctification&#x2015;all of which are fused together at the hub of his book on divine impassibility. He and his wife, LuWinn, have four children.</p><p>Associate Professor of Biblical and Theological Studies, Talbot School of Theology</p><br><br><p><strong>Bruce A.

Rupert and Lucille Coleman Professor of Christian Theology, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Though a young and upcoming evangelical scholar, Rob Lister has made a very significant contribution to one of the most difficult theological doctrines, the impassibility of God. By combining historical theology, interaction with contemporary nonevangelical theories, a retroductive theological method, circumspect metaphysical reflection on divine revelation, biblical theology, and systematic theology (especially theology proper and christology), Lister offers a convincing case that God is both impassible and impassioned. This book sets the standard on this topic and is a model of evangelical scholarship at its finest!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gregg R. Allison,</strong> Professor of Christian Theology, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary; Elder, Sojourn Community Church; author, <em>Sojourners and Strangers</em>; <em>Roman Catholic Theology and Practice</em>; and <em>Historical Theology</em></p><p>&#x201c;Although the concept of divine passibilism, appropriate in some ways for a deeply sentimentalized culture, is all the rage in modern theology, for most of the history of the church, God was viewed as being impassible. Why was this so, and how did the Bible shape this perspective of God? And can we construct a model in this regard that does justice to what the Scriptures and church history say about God, and that also engages with modern sensibilities? This study by Rob Lister is extremely helpful in answering these questions: it is preeminently scriptural, takes the <em>Rezeptionsgeschichte</em> of this doctrine very seriously, and satisfactorily answers current concerns.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael A. G. Haykin,</strong> Professor of Church History and Biblical Spirituality, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Rob Lister boldly goes where few evangelicals have gone before in this very helpful study of how best to make sense of what Scripture says about God&#x2019;s emotions. Lister does away with caricatures of the Patristic tradition as having sold out to Greek philosophy, surveys contemporary evangelical positions on divine impassibility, and provides a constructive hermeneutical method and theological model for doing justice both to the impassibilist tradition and to biblical language about divine emotions. As G. K. Chesterton observes, &#x2018;an inch is everything when you&#x2019;re balancing,&#x2019; and to Lister&#x2019;s credit he completes his routine without falling off the balance beam that is systematic theology.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Kevin J. Vanhoozer,</strong> Research Professor of Systematic Theology, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; author, <em>The Drama of Doctrine</em>; <em>Hearers and Doers</em>; <em>Biblical Authority after Babel</em>; and <em>Faith Speaking Understanding</em></p><p>&#x201c;Understanding how an infinite God relates to finite creatures is at the heart of most theological difficulties. How can God be holy and sovereign <em>and</em> personal and relational? That God is transcendent and immanent is central to understanding the God of the Bible. In this book, Rob Lister has given us tremendous help in navigating these deep theological waters. His theological method is a fantastic and much needed model of biblically grounded synthetic analysis that incorporates keen exegetical insights that are well informed by historical theology. Lister offers a biblically balanced understanding of God&#x2019;s emotional life so that his sovereign majesty and covenant intimacy are preserved. The implications of this study for understanding God, humanity, Christ, relationships, and emotions in general are far-reaching and vital. I pray that the conclusions and theological method of this excellent work are deeply and widely influential for the glory of God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>K. Erik Thoennes,</strong> Professor and Chair of Theology, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University; Elder of Congregational Life, Grace Evangelical Free Church, La Mirada, California</p><p>&#x201c;In this well-organized and well-written volume, Rob Lister challenges the view that the church fathers&#x2019; version of divine impassibility precluded God&#x2019;s showing emotion. He swims upstream against modern passibilism, and he opposes those evangelicals who reject impassibility in the name of affirming divine passion. I was impressed with Lister&#x2019;s accuracy and kindness whenever he takes exception to others&#x2019; views. The work is largely positive and constructive rather than negative and reactive. Lister argues &#x2018;passionately&#x2019; for the view that God is both impassible and impassioned, even as he is both transcendent and immanent. Lister&#x2019;s work demonstrates multiple areas of competence&#x2015;historical, biblical, theological, and philosophical&#x2015;and is nuanced, holding that &#x2018;God&#x2019;s passion transcends human passion both ontologically and ethically.&#x2019; I am, therefore, pleased to commend it to readers for serious consideration.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Robert A. Peterson,</strong>&nbsp;independent researcher, St. Louis, Missouri</p><p>&#x201c;Whether God is subject to suffering is hardly a recent question, but it is an issue that contemporary Christians have been constrained to ponder carefully in order to provide scripturally measured and biblically tempered answers in a generation that prefers to conceive of and worship a God forged after human likeness. Despite the profundity of this issue and the inherent difficulty of giving adequate expression to whether God is passible or impassible, Rob Lister provides accessibility and clarity to this issue in a scripturally governed, admirably balanced, and manifestly humble manner. He engages theologians ancient and modern as his theological conversation partners while he guides readers through the many pitfalls and hazards that threaten to entangle us primarily in two antithetical but equally defective views of God: either to cast him in our image and likeness or to project onto him an aloofness that renders him cold, even grotesque. Lister rightly insists that in order to provide biblically rooted answers to the questions he addresses it is crucial to acknowledge and embrace the chasm that distinguishes the Creator from his creatures. Yet, equally crucial is the fact that the Creator made humanity, the creature, in his image and after his likeness, for this is God&#x2019;s revelatory nexus by which God makes himself known to us both as impassible and as impassioned.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ardel B. Caneday,</strong> Professor of New Testament Studies and Biblical Theology, Northwestern College; coauthor, <em>The Race Set Before Us: A Biblical Theology of Perseverance and Assurance</em></p><p>&#x201c;This is an excellent study in systematic theology that exemplifies detailed research in biblical theology and historical theology, and draws these into a coherent systematic construction with relevance for contemporary life. I found Lister&#x2019;s hermeneutical and theological analyses of passibilist and impassibilist arguments to be instructive and sharp. The project is well conceived and follows an explicit methodology with systematic guardrails from Scripture to frame the difficult biblical and theological details. Lister has ably handled difficult questions that impinge on God&#x2019;s impassibility and passionate involvement with his creations: God&#x2019;s relation to time and eternity, incarnate suffering, biblical accounts of God&#x2019;s repentance, theodicy, and God&#x2019;s immanence and transcendence. Despite the difficulties, Lister provides careful definitional distinctions and clarity of communication in a surprisingly light writing style that is uncommon to academic theology.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John E.

The former British colony of Southern Rhodesia rejected British moves towards majority rule and on 11 November 1965 the Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith announced his country's Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Great Britain. That act sparked a series of violent encounters between the traditional colonial army and the African guerilla insurgents of the Patriotic Front.

Bestselling romance novelist Hunter, in her newest, offers the requisite great kiss and loads of tension between Josephine Mitchell, who returns to her family's Blue Ridge Orchard when her sister's pregnancy becomes a crisis, and Grady MacKenzie, the orchard manager, who doesn't trust Josie for a minute. There are secrets to be kept, guilt to overcome, past heartbreak to repair&#x2014;all fodder for a good romance. The author adds more weight than usual as Josie's guilt over an accident in her past threatens her very life, but like all good romances, everything is tied up at the end. And even though the tale becomes overwrought as Hunter plumbs the depths of Josie and Grady's thoughts and introduces a plethora of side plots (Aunt Lola's pie; Alzheimer's suffered by the father of Josie's childhood friend; Josie's father) this Women of Faith Fiction title is sure to grab readers by the heart. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As in any Cook novel, the scientific details are fascinating, but here the characters are underdeveloped, and the constant objectification of Pia by almost every man who crosses her path wears thin. --Kristine Huntley</p><h2>Cherry Lane</h2><p><b>From the author of "</b><b>wonderful, warm, intriguing romance" (Jill Shalvis) comes a charming tale of finding family when you least expect it -- perfect f</b><b>or fans of Brenda Jackson, Beverly Jenkins, and Robyn Carr. </b><br><br>In New York City, attorney Devon Gilmore devoted all her time and energy to fast-track her career.

Two Birds had found the abandoned wolf pup, and they had grown up together. Now, the wild was calling, and Two Birds had a choice to make. Struggling with a mix of emotions, he must decide whether his love for the wolf is greater than his need to be near it. Will Two Birds learn to let go&#x2014;not just of the wolf, but also of his own fears? <br><br>Whispers of the Wolf is a beautiful picture book set around 500 years ago among the Pueblo Indians of the desert Southwest. A heartwarming piece of historical fiction, it weaves together themes of community, tradition, self-esteem, and respect for all life, creating a realistic portrait of a culture that continues to exert a vibrant, living influence today.</p><p>Pauline Ts'o is an author, illustrator, screenwriter, photographer, and co-founder of Rhythm and Hues Studios, a computer animation and visual effects company that has won multiple Academy Awards (Life of Pi, Babe, and The Golden Compass&#x2015;Best Visual Effects). Pauline's production credits as a digital artist and lighting/art director include Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Disney's theme park attraction It's Tough to be a Bug, and various commercials, including the first Coca-Cola Polar Bear spot. She lives in Los Angeles, CA, with her husband and two fast-growing twins.K-Gr 2&#x2014;Two Birds is shy and feels isolated from the other boys in his 16th-century Pueblo village. One day, he finds an abandoned wolf pup and decides to rescue and raise it. Through his wolf, he finds his voice as a storyteller and earns the respect and friendship of his peers. Eventually, he must choose whether to keep his wolf in captivity or allow it to run free and pursue its true nature. The stylized pastel illustrations successfully support the emotions of the story and do a particularly nice job of connecting the grandeur of the natural world to Two Birds's daily life. Ts'o includes notes on each of the illustrations, including information about cultural practices, environmental and historical context, and suggestions for further reading. The story is historical fiction, not a retelling of a traditional story or legend, and although she is not Native herself, the author has made an effort to respectfully tell a story that will resonate with modern-day Pueblos without appropriation. In her foreword, Rosemary Apple Blossom Lonewolf, who is enrolled in the Santa Clara Pueblo (Tewa) tribe, states that "I am happy to declare Whispers of the Wolf a satisfying blend of words and images descriptive of a young Pueblo boy's life." The book also includes an approving preface by Vivian Arviso Deloria, an educator enrolled in the Navajo nation.

In this book, one of America's leading ethnobotanists warns about our loss of natural vegetation and plant diversity while providing insights into traditional Native agricultural practices in the Americas.<br><br> Gary Paul Nabhan here reveals the rich diversity of plants found in tropical forests and their contribution to modern crops, then tells how this diversity is being lost to agriculture and lumbering. He then relates "local parables" of Native American agriculture&#x2014;from wild rice in the Great Lakes region to wild gourds in Florida&#x2014;that convey the urgency of this situation and demonstrate the need for saving the seeds of endangered plants. Nabhan stresses the need for maintaining a wide gene pool, not only for the survival of these species but also for the preservation of genetic strains that can help scientists breed more resilient varieties of other plants.<br><br><i>Enduring Seeds</i> is a book that no one concerned with our environment can afford to ignore. It clearly shows us that, as agribusiness increasingly limits the food on our table, a richer harvest can be had by preserving ancient ways.<br><br><i>This edition features a new foreword by Miguel Altieri, one of today's leading spokesmen for sustainable agriculture and the preservation of indigenous farming methods.</i></p><p>A MacArthur Fellow and recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society for Conservation Biology, Gary Paul Nabhan is Director of the Center for Sustainable Environments at Northern Arizona University.Few of us are familiar with the Okeechobee gourd of the wild sunflower Helianthus exilus , yet these plants are the source of improved garden squash and sunflowers. We need to draw on wild plants for certain qualitiesresistance to disease, insect and drought, tolerance to salt in the soil; the current rate of vegetation destruction in diminishing the availabiity of wild plant resources. Nabhan, assistant director of Phoenix's Desert Botanical Garden and author of The Desert Smells Like Rain , here discusses desert ecology, native American agriculture and wild seed conservation. He looks at centuries of plant culture in the Southwest and takes us to dry tropical forests of Central America where seed agriculture probably originated. Nabhan focuses on specific crops: wild rice, sunflowers, gourds and the "factory" turkey; the latter exemplifies a shallow gene pool (Indians bred turkeys selectively for feathers). Nabhan also reports on seed-conservation groups and their efforts to re-introduce old seeds into the ecosystem. This is for readers interested in ecology, especially for gardeners, farmers, botanists. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Making of Modern Japan</h2><p><p>Magisterial in vision, sweeping in scope, this monumental work presents a seamless account of Japanese society during the modern era, from 1600 to the present. A distillation of more than fifty years&#x2019; engagement with Japan and its history, it is the crowning work of our leading interpreter of the modern Japanese experience.</p><p>Since 1600 Japan has undergone three periods of wrenching social and institutional change, following the imposition of hegemonic order on feudal society by the Tokugawa shogun; the opening of Japan&#x2019;s ports by Commodore Perry; and defeat in World War II. <i>The Making of Modern Japan</i> charts these changes: the social engineering begun with the founding of the shogunate in 1600, the emergence of village and castle towns with consumer populations, and the diffusion of samurai values in the culture.</p><p>Marius Jansen covers the making of the modern state, the adaptation of Western models, growing international trade, the broadening opportunity in Japanese society with industrialization, and the postwar occupation reforms imposed by General MacArthur. Throughout, the book gives voice to the individuals and views that have shaped the actions and beliefs of the Japanese, with writers, artists, and thinkers, as well as political leaders given their due.</p><p>The story this book tells, though marked by profound changes, is also one of remarkable consistency, in which continuities outweigh upheavals in the development of society, and successive waves of outside influence have only served to strengthen a sense of what is unique and native to Japanese experience. <i>The Making of Modern Japan</i> takes us to the core of this experience as it illuminates one of the contemporary world&#x2019;s most compelling transformations.</p></p><p>Marius B. Jansen was Professor Emeritus of Japanese History and East Asian Studies, Princeton University, and author of <i>Sakamoto Ryoma and the Meiji Restoration</i>.&#x201c;An elegant, lucid, and magisterial book. A distillation of more than fifty years' engagement with Japan and its history, it presents the sweeping vision of our leading interpreter of the modern Japanese experience over the past half-millennium. Marius Jansen has integrated his own scholarship and that of many others in a lively account that has great potential as a text for survey courses in modern Japanese history; professionals in the field will benefit from its integrity and interpretive breadth. Moreover, Jansen's own enthusiasm and love for his subject come through every bit as clearly as his profound erudition; that sense of excitement carries the reader along smoothly and effortlessly. The book is a pleasure to read.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ronald P.

He refuses to see Japan in isolation, as a kind of sealed-off island of uniqueness...Indeed, he argues that political developments in Japan were almost always responses to events outside: Perry's ships, Western colonialism, Russian and later Soviet expansion, the world stock market crash of 1929 and so on. He also goes out of his way to show how liberalism in Japan always had a chance. Authoritarianism and war were never inevitable consequences of some deep Japanese warrior instinct; when given the opportunity, the Japanese, like the rest of us, want to be free and live in peace.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ian Buruman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Now in a magisterial book that's also highly readable, Marius Jansen has told the story of Meiji and with it the creation of modern Japan...Jansen takes the reader by the hand to show what happened and why in those intense, formative years. A master of his craft, he allows the Meiji reformers, their opponents and foreign observers of that day to tell the story. He also gives credit to the views of contemporary historians, both Japanese and Westerners, who have handled the subject...The capstone of Jansen's work as America's foremost historian of Japan, this book will long be must reading for students. But the author's relaxed style, his eye for people and the clarity and patience of his explanations should appeal to any thoughtful reader.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Frank Gibney</b><b>, </b><b><i>Washington Post Book World</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;For answers to...questions about modern Japan, there can be few better guides than Marius Jansen's splendid new history. The product of more than 50 years' study, this book combines grand sweep with vivid and telling anecdote. It is also admirably balanced. While Jansen's affection for Japan is clear ('a gifted, resourceful and courageous nation'), he is scathing in his judgement of the arrogance and ruthlessness of some of its leaders.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Geoffrey Owen</b><b>, </b><b><i>Sunday Telegraph</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;At the end of a long and distinguished career, Jansen has produced what is sure to become the standard narrative history of modern Japan, a cornucopia of information, explanation, interpretation, and careful reflection about the historical development of Japan...Jansen tells his story gracefully and with remarkable thoroughness, and enlivens it with ample detail and engaging anecdotes; personalities of the leading figures stand forth boldly and memorably. While unmistakably his own, Jansen's account makes room for the views and voices of countless other scholars of Japan (even those with whom he disagrees), giving it the impact of a consensus narrative setting forth the full spectrum of opinion on Japan among scholars both in Japan and elsewhere. In every way this is a remarkable book. Without doubt it will create its own exclusive niche in the literature, and no reference collection on Japan can pretend to be complete without it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>C. L.

Born in northern India on January 5, 1893, he devoted his life to helping people of all races and creeds to realize and express more fully in their lives the true beauty, nobility, and divinity of the human spirit. After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Mrinalini Mata, one of his closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 2011. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.Yogananda has become an image - a remarkable, deep, sweet, poetic, ecstatic man enraptured of cosmic life - who has changed the map of American religious life. --Robert Ellwood, Ph.

But few may know of the role Shambhala played in Russian geopolitics in the early twentieth century. Perhaps the only one on the subject, Andrei Znamenski's book presents a wholly different glimpse of early Soviet history both erudite and fascinating. Using archival sources and memoirs, he explores how spiritual adventurers, revolutionaries, and nationalists West and East exploited Shambhala to promote their fanatical schemes, focusing on the Bolshevik attempt to use Mongol-Tibetan prophecies to railroad Communism into inner Asia. We meet such characters as Gleb Bokii, the Bolshevik secret police commissar who tried to use Buddhist techniques to conjure the ideal human; and Nicholas Roerich, the Russian painter who, driven by his otherworldly Master and blackmailed by the Bolshevik secret police, posed as a reincarnation of the Dalai Lama to unleash religious war in Tibet. We also learn of clandestine activities of the Bolsheviks from the Mongol-Tibetan Section of the Communist International who took over Mongolia and then, dressed as lama pilgrims, tried to set Tibet ablaze; and of their opponent, Ja-Lama, an "avenging lama" fond of spilling blood during his tantra rituals.</p><p><b>Andrei Znamenski</b> studied history and anthropology both in Russia and the United States. Formerly a resident scholar at the Library of Congress, then a foreign visiting professor at Hokkaido University, Japan, he has taught at The University of Memphis and Alabama State University. His fields of interests include religions of indigenous people of Siberia and North America, shamanism, and esotericism. Znamenski is the author of <i>Shamanism and Christianity</i> (1999), <i>Through Orthodox Eyes</i> (2003), <i>Shamanism in Siberia</i> (2003), <i>The Beauty of the Primitive: Shamanism and Western Imagination</i> (2007), and the editor of the three-volume anthology <i>Shamanism: Critical Concepts</i> (2004)."The above [Alexander Barchenko, Ja-Lama and Nicholas Roerich]are only three out of the eleven figures historian Andrei Znamenski introduces at the beginning of <i>Red Shambhala</i>, and in their oddness and ambition--and the oddness of their ambitions--they are representative of the eccentric would-be messiahs (sincere and otherwise) who populate Znamenski's lively account of the ways traditional beliefs common in Tibet, Mongolia, and surrounding areas came into play in the competition between Russia and England for dominance in that region." --<b>David Cozy, <i>Japan Times<br></i><br><br>"I've been waiting for a good excuse to bring up Andrei Znamenski's <i>Red Shambhala: Magic, Prophesy, and Geopolitics in the Heart of Asia</i>.

Featuring countless cowboys and cowgirls, including such Western legends as Buffalo Bill, Geronimo, and Bill Picket, it was only a matter of time before it caught the glittering eye of Hollywood. </p><p>From the legendary cattle drives along the Chisholm Trail to the origins of the mass entertainment industry, Michael Wallis masterfully tells the enthralling history of not only the 101 ranch, but the last days of the American Frontier.</p></p><p>Although not as renowned as Buffalo Bill Cody, Joseph Miller and his brothers were in many ways as impressive as impresarios. Their Wild West shows, which competed with Cody's show and the Ringling Brothers' circuses, featured talent like Will Rogers and Tom Mix and significantly influenced American mass entertainment. In <i>The Real Wild West</i>, Michael Wallis makes a case that the Millers didn't just invent the romantic West but lived it as well.<p> Like Cody before them, the Millers took their cues from the frontier, largely because they played a significant part in its conquest. The family's rambunctious Kentuckian patriarch, George Washington Miller, abandoned the bluegrass of his home state to raise cattle on the greener pastures of the plains. His sons followed suit, but in 1905, a rodeo at the 101, their 100,000-acre-plus Oklahoma ranch, for the National Editorial Association led to a new career in popular entertainment. Within a decade, film producer Thomas Ince had set up shop nearby, utilizing talent from the 101 for his westerns. (It was Ince's mysterious death, combined with revelations of financial chicanery, that ultimately destroyed the enterprise in the 1920s.)</p><p> Wallis doesn't sugarcoat accusations of murder and illegal financial maneuverings on the part of the Millers, instead making interesting parallels between their ruthlessness and business acumen and the romantic vision of the West they presented to early-20th-century audiences. His account is also notable for its numerous biographies of 101 performers--people like Princess Wenona, the Native American rival to Annie Oakley, and Bill Pickett, an African American cowhand who founded most of the events on the professional rodeo circuit--and conveys the enthusiasm many must have felt during the Wild West shows' heyday. <i>--John M. Anderson</i></p>"It's hard to imagine a better fit between subject and author than Michael Wallis and the 101 Ranch. Michael Wallis's deep knowledge of Oklahoma--both its history and character--enables him to tell the story of this legendary group of entrepreneurs and ranch hands with vividness and verve. The book is a very good read." --Larry McMurtry, author of <i>Lonesome Dove</i><p> "For decades the story of 101 Ranch and the Miller family has delighted young and old alike. I was privileged to know quite a few of the 101 gang such as Tom Mix, Ken Maynard, Buck Jones, Will Rogers, and Yakima Canutt. The stories they could tell left you breathless and wanting more. Michael Wallis's book will serve as an outstanding and entertaining guide to an institution that has played a significant role in the history of our great country." --Gene Autry</p><p> "There are no better stories than those of the Miller brothers and the 101 Ranch. There is no other writer who could have re-created the fun and games and drama of this extraordinary saga better than Michael Wallis. Every character and episode spring and hump and vibrate from page to page, happening to happening. To borrow a relative term--this book is a hoot!" --Jim Lehrer</p></p><h2>Connected: Living in the Light of the Trinity</h2><p>How is the doctrine of the Trinity really meant to be understood?

The Chess Publishing Event of the Decade! The years after the Second World War saw international chess dominated by the Soviets Botvinnik, Smyslov, Tal, Petrosian and then Spassky held the world crown, treating it as if it were almost an integral part of their country s heritage. There were occasional flashes of brilliance in the West Reshevsky, Najdorf, and later Larsen but no one really mounted a serious challenge to the Russian hegemony. Then, in the mid-1950s, a lone genius from Brooklyn emerged. Obsessed with chess, all his waking hours became devoted to finding truth on the 64 squares. It was an unrelenting, sometimes frustrating quest, but he persevered, eventually emerging as perhaps the greatest natural chess talent ever. It was clear from his early years as a gifted prodigy through his stormy ascent of the Chess Olympus, no one had ever rocked the chess world quite like Bobby Fischer. His raw genius for the royal game, combined with an indefatigable will to win, made him one of the most feared chessplayers of all time a genuine living legend. Now, for the first time, every single one of his tournament and match games is presented with insightful explanations and analysis. Best-selling chess author, German International Grandmaster Karsten Mueller, annotates each game of the player many believe to be the greatest of all time. All 736 serious tournament games are supplemented by crosstables of every major tournament and match in which Fischer participated, dozens of archival photographs, along with brief comments and observations putting the play of the great champion into historical perspective.</p><p>Karsten Mueller is one of the best chess authors in the world today. His ChessCafe Puzzle Book series is a widely acclaimed best selling series.

Focusing less on institutional and doctrinal history and more on the varied popular religious practices and sites, his volume highlights, for example, the influence of Caribbean religions in the United States, practices of divination and healing, the surge of black Muslim religion, the emergence of black humanism, and the religious influence and ethical practices of black women.</p><p>Anthony B.

Considered one of the greatest THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST is a farce, playing with love, religion, and truth as it tells the tale of two men. Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff, who bend the truth in order to add excitement to their lives. Jack invents an imaginary brother, Ernest, whom he uses as an excuse to escape from his dull country home and gallavant in town. Meanwhile, Algernon follows Jack&#39;s scam, but his imaginary friend, Bumbury, provides a convenient method of adventuring in the country. However, their deceptions eventually cross paths, resulting in a series of crises that threaten to spoil their romantic pursuits. Hailed as the first modern comedy in England, THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST is Wilde&#39;s most famous work. This collection also features two other plays that Wilde penned earlier in his career, LADY WINDERMERE&#39;S FAN and AN IDEAL HUSBAND, that also display his ability to convey warmth and wit through his hilarious characters and their outlandish situations.</p><p>A collection of literature anthologies and reference books for Key Stage 3 onwards.This is a full cast production with sound effects and original music produced at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.</p><h2>The Distraction Addiction: Getting the Information You Need and the Communication You Want, Without Enraging Your Family, Annoying Your Colleagues, and Destroying Your Soul</h2><p>The question of our time: can we reclaim our lives in an age that feels busier and more distracting by the day? <br> We've all found ourselves checking email at the dinner table, holding our breath while waiting for Outlook to load, or sitting hunched in front of a screen for an hour longer than we intended. <br> Mobile devices and the web have invaded our lives, and this is a big idea book that addresses one of the biggest questions of our age: can we stay connected without diminishing our intelligence, attention spans, and ability to really live?

He most recent book is <i>Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less</i>."Amusing and edifying.... THE DISTRACTION ADDICTION is not framed as a self-help book...It's a thoughtful examination of the perils of our computing overdose and a historical overview of how technological advances change consciousness." -- <em>Washington Post</em><br><br>"A perceptive new study of how best to cope with the relentless interruptions presented by digital life...Pang persuasively and carefully constructs a remedy he calls 'contemplative computing'... to think clearly and calmly, Pang offers original and often inspired ideas." -- <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em><br><br>"Skeptical without pandering to technophobia or neuroscience....<i> The Distraction Addiction</i> brims with suggestions for how to embrace 'contemplative computing,' a mindful approach to digital technology... Instead of shunning the technological in pursuit of the mythical authentic experience, Pang wants to clean up the mess it created." -- <i>The New Yorker</i><i></i><br><br>"Pang's strength is his ability to weave together previously written-about ideas from such varied sources as histories of science (e.g., Darwin's daily walk) and Silicon Valley propaganda (the 'digital Sabbath')." -- <em>Cleveland Plain Dealer</em><br><br>"An elegant tour through current neuroscience and an examination of the nature of attention. Pang's tome is a valuable resource for anyone seeking to take control of his or her digital life, and it's a great primer on the interplay between mind and tech." -- <em>Publishers Weekly</em><br><br>"Pang reminds us that our brains are still capable of feats far beyond the reach of computers." -- <em>Mother Jones</em><br><br>"Pang implores us to use technology more mindfully in this thoughtful book that is rich in research and anecdote.

These accounts, including the surprising use of social media by Buddhist monks and a lengthy analysis of Darwin's method of reflection through walking, are the best part of Pang's book, placing today's current tech "addiction" into a broader context of human history, development, and philosophical insight." -- <i>Booklist</i><br><br>"Pang's notion of mindful, or contemplative, computing is useful." -- <i>TechCrunch</i><br><br>"A wise, urbane, funny, and delightfully deep book. This book is about much more than distraction and addiction in the smartphone age. It's about living life wholly and fully by paying deep, thoughtful attention to our tools and our bodies, and to the people we love.

B.; John O'Hara, "master of the fancied slight"; and, among a hundred others, Peter Arno, Saul Steinberg, Edmund Wilson, and Lewis Mumford. Brendan Gill has known them all, and by virtue of his virtually total recall, keen eye, and impeccable prose, his diverting portraits of these eccentrics in rage and repose are amply supplied with both dimples and warts. <i>Here at the New Yorker</i>&#x2014;now updated with a new introduction detailing the reigns of Robert Gottlieb and Tina Brown&#x2014;is a delightful tour of New York's most glorious madhouse.</p><p>Brendan Gill sold his first story to the <i>New Yorker</i> in 1936, when he was 21, and has worked there ever since. When his irreverent memoir appeared in 1975, it caused the most delightful of frissons, because the outside world then knew little about his workplace. Gill declares that "in the old Ross-Shawn days, what hadn't happened at the magazine was more worthy of note than what had." In reality, of course, a great deal was happening, and Gill seems to have heard and remembered it all. (This edition also contains a 1997 introduction, complete with acute and politic comments on the Bob Gottlieb and Tina Brown regimes.) But <i>Here at the New Yorker</i> is far from an expos�, consisting instead of the recollections of a lucky man who loves his work and many of his fellows. <p> Each reader will have his or her favorite anecdotes. Gill remembers taking the subway with Marianne Moore, who was squeezed next to two high school musicians. "Miss Moore stared with admiration at the drum, then said to the boy holding the drumsticks, 'Sonny, when the time comes, give it a big bang just for me.'" And, speaking of big bangs, the old <i>New Yorker</i> was far more squeamish--an organ in which bare nipples were nowhere to be found. Its first editor, Harold Ross, shown a cartoon complete with one such entity, growled: "Take that goddam tit up to Mrs. White and ask <i>her</i> what to do about it." His successor, William Shawn, shared his modesty though not his speech patterns. When Mr. Shawn asked the novelist Henry Green what led him to write <i>Loving</i>, Green's reply wasn't quite what he had expected. Alas, readers, you must turn to page 386 of this endlessly charming book for the offending response.</p><b>Brendan Gill (1914&#x2013;1997)</b> was a staff writer for the<i>New Yorker</i> for over sixty years.

In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of 'advanced' democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought.</p><p>In <i>Laches, Charmides,</i> and <i>Lysis,</i> Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. <i>Protagoras, Ion,</i> and <i>Meno</i> discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In <i>Gorgias,</i> Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The <i>Apology</i> (not a dialogue), <i>Crito, Euthyphro,</i> and the unforgettable <i>Phaedo</i> relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous <i>Symposium</i> and <i>Phaedrus,</i> written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. <i>Cratylus</i> discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the <i>Republic,</i> concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery).

The name of a small, seemingly insignificant Flemish village echoes across the twentieth century as the ultimate expression of meaningless, industrialized slaughter. In the summer of 1917, upwards of 500,000 men were killed or wounded, maimed, gassed, drowned, or buried in this small corner of Belgium.<br>On the centennial of the battle, military historian Nick Lloyd brings to vivid life this epic encounter along the Western Front. Drawing on both British and German sources, he is the first historian to reveal the astonishing fact that, for the British, Passchendaele was an eminently winnable battle. Yet the advance of British troops was undermined by their own high command, which, blinded by hubris, clung to failed tactics. The result was a familiar one: stalemate. Lloyd forces us to consider that trench warfare was not necessarily a futile endeavor, and that had the British won at Passchendaele, they might have ended the war early, saving hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lives. A captivating narrative of heroism and folly, <i>Passchendaele </i>is an essential addition to the literature on the Great War.<br></p><p><b>Nick Lloyd </b>is a senior lecturer in defense studies at King's College London and the author of <i>Hundred Days</i>.

A key point of contention is the meaning and authority of the biblical witness. In this brief book, two New Testament scholars discuss the relevant biblical texts on the subject of homosexual behavior and orientation. Discussing both Old Testament and New Testament texts, each author also raises important interpretive and moral questions and then offers a response to the other&#39;s main assertions. Chief questions examined by each include what the Bible has to say about homosexuality and homosexual behavior, the meaning of those texts in their cultural contexts, and the larger hermeneutical dilemma of what kind of authority the Bible&#39;s teaching, if recoverable, has for Christians today. A thoughtful and irenic dialogue, this volume can facilitate reflection and discussion among church members on a vital and contentious issue in American church life.</p><p>Dan O.

In <i>Saved from Sacrifice</i> theologian Mark Heim takes on this paradox, asserting that the cross must be understood against the whole history of human scapegoating violence.<br><br> In order to highlight the dimensions of his argument, Heim carefully and critically draws on the groundbreaking work of French theorist and biblical scholar Ren� Girard. Yet Heim goes beyond Girard to develop a comprehensive theology of the atonement and the cross through his fresh readings of well-known biblical passages and his exploration of the place of the victim.<br><br></p><p>S. Mark Heim is Samuel Abbot Professor of Christian Theology at Andover Newton Theological School, Newton Centre, Massachusetts. He is also the author of <em>Salvations: Truth and Difference in Religion</em>.<b>John Hoffmeyer in&nbsp;<i>Lutheran Quarterly</i></b><br> "This is an excellent work that leaves me hoping for a sequel."<br><br><b>Daniel L. Migliore</b><br> &#x2014; Princeton Theological Seminary<br> "Drawing extensively from Ren? Girard's analysis of the scapegoat mechanism, Mark Heim has written a not-to-be-missed work on the unmasking of sacrificial violence by the biblical witness. He offers stunning interpretations of Old and New Testament texts as he marshals his argument that the event of the cross narrated in the Gospels is universally significant not because it repeats the deadly cycle of sacrifice present in all societies and in all religious ritual and myth but because it reverses this cycle and rescues us from the practice of scapegoating sacrifice and the violence it both hides and perpetuates. This is a theology of the cross in a bold new key."<br><br><b>Robert J. Daly, S.J.</b><br> &#x2014; Boston College<br> "<i>Saved from Sacrifice</i>&nbsp;provides what, for example, Mel Gibson's&nbsp;<i>Passion of the Christ</i>&nbsp;is disappointingly unaware of &#x2014; a&nbsp;<i>theology</i>&nbsp;of the cross. Heim saves us from having to think of God as a cruel sacrifice-demander; saves us from the terrible consequences of thinking that God wanted his Son to suffer terribly; reminds us that the passion is not what God the Father did to Jesus but is what we did to Jesus; and saves us from the terrible 'theological' consequences of thinking that God actually wanted, willed, or demanded the violent things that were done to Jesus. If, for example, God does violence in order to achieve a good end (our salvation), should not we, in imitation of God, also be willing to use violence to achieve what we see as good?&nbsp;<i>Saved from Sacrifice</i>&nbsp;saves us from such a profoundly distorted view of God and Christianity, and it challenges us to refocus our attention on a more authentically Christian view of the transforming mystery of the cross of Christ. This is one of the most important and profoundly needed books to appear in our day. Its unveiling of the inherently un-Christian nature of all violence is desperately needed in our contemporary world."<br><br><b>Carol Zaleski</b><br> &#x2014; Smith College<br> "<i>Sacrifice</i>. It's the most stirringly profound and most cruelly misunderstood word in our spiritual lexicon. S. Mark Heim has performed a great service in providing a lucid, learned, ecumenical appraisal of what sacrifice has meant and continues to mean today. A Girardian who truly appreciates the atonement theologies of the past, Heim enables Christian readers of all viewpoints to renew their humbled awareness of the cross as the sacrifice to end all sacrifices."<br><br><b>J. Denny Weaver</b><br> &#x2014; Bluffton University<br> "<i>Saved from Sacrifice</i>&nbsp;will surely prove one of the most important of recent analyses of atonement and violence as well as the most thorough from a Girardian perspective. Its restatement of an atonement motif holds out the promise of productive conversation with other strands of theology."<br><br><b>Gabriel Fackre</b><br> &#x2014; Andover Newton Theological School<br> "In this provocative work Mark Heim sees with a Girardian eye what may be unnoticed aspects of the atonement. While this is no substitute for classical understandings of the work of Christ, the reader is urged to follow Heim's search for a yet-to-be discerned dimension of the doctrine."<br><br><b>James Alison</b><br> &#x2014; Catholid theologian, priest, and author<br> "Mark Heim has given us both a very accurate reading of the thought of Girard as it relates to the cross and a superb reworking of the doctrine of atonement. He shows how the only way through the knots of bad atonement theology is to a richer and more conservative understanding of the truth revealed by the cross. He has the ability to read texts and doctrines stereoscopically, making available and alive the way in which two apparent opposites (Christ's death was not a sacrifice at all, and it was the one true sacrifice) are both true and illuminate each other. He has a real theologian's ability to dwell on the knife-edge of interpretation and tell the truth. His study of what others have said is always deepened by his own superb readings of texts from scripture and his bringing alive of insights into the complexities of human relating. If, as it deserves, and as I very much hope,&nbsp;<i>Saved from Sacrifice</i>&nbsp;becomes the standard atonement textbook in the training of a whole generation of preachers and ministers, then the quality of our preaching and of our Christian living will have received an enormous fillip."<br><br><b><i>Theological Book Review</i></b><br> "Heim's work is an impressive example of the power of Girard's analysis. He recognizes that this perspective does not do full justice to all the dimensions of the cross but convincingly demonstrates the significance of this angle on atonement."<br><br><b><i>Theological Studies</i></b><br> "A remarkably rich yet coherent reading of Christian theology and history that does more than simply compile what others have said."<br><br><b><i>Interpretation</i></b><br> "Heim offers a fresh and very welcome understanding of the saving significance of the cross. I would enthusiastically commend this book for all who are engaged in theological education and pastoral ministry."</p><h2>Cahiers du Cin�ma: The 1950s: Neo-Realism, Hollywood, New Wave (Harvard Film Studies)</h2><p><p><i>Cahiers du Cin�ma</i> is the most prestigious and influential film journal ever published. An anthology devoted entirely to its writings, in English translation, is long overdue.</p><p>The selections in this volume are drawn from the colorful first decade of <i>Cahiers</i>, 1951&#x2013;1959, when a group of young iconoclasts rocked the world of film criticism with their provocative views on international cinema&#x2015;American, Italian, and French in particular. They challenged long-established Anglo-Saxon attitudes by championing American popular movies, addressing genres such as the Western and the thriller and the aesthetics of technological developments like CinemaScope, emphasizing <i>mise en sc�ne</i> as much as thematic content, and assessing the work of individual filmmakers such as Hawks, Hitchcock, and Nicholas Ray in terms of a new theory of the director as author, <i>auteur</i>, a revolutionary concept at the time. Italian film, especially the work of Rossellini, prompted sharp debates about realism that helped shift the focus of critical discussion from content toward style. The critiques of French cinema have special interest because many of the journal&#x2019;s major contributors and theorists&#x2015;Godard, Truffaut, Rohmer, Rivette, Chabrol&#x2015;were to become some of France&#x2019;s most important film directors and leaders of the New Wave.</p><p>Translated under the supervision of the British Film Institute, the selections have for the most part never appeared in English until now. Jim Hillier has organized them into topical groupings and has provided introductions to the parts as well as the whole. Together these essays, reviews, discussions, and polemics reveal the central ideas of the <i>Cahiers</i> of the 1950s not as fixed doctrines but as provocative, productive, often contradictory contributions to crucial debates that were to overturn critical thinking about film.</p></p><p>Jim Hillier is Senior Lecturer in Film Studies, Bulmershe College of Higher Education, Reading, England.&#x201c;A good case can be made for the 1950s as the most stimulating decade in the annals of film criticism. Credit for this goes largely to the French journal <i>Cahiers du Cin�ma</i>, which nurtured and published a small band of iconoclasts who later moved into active filmmaking and became the core of the influential New Wave group. Jean-Luc Godard and the late Fran�ois Truffaut were probably its most important members, with Jacques Rivette, Eric Rohmer, and Claude Chobrol right at their heels... Jim Hillier&#x2019;s collection...concentrates on the 1950s, assessing the pre-New Wave cinema of France, as well as classical Hollywood film and Italy&#x2019;s neo-realist school. It also treats such technical issues as the essence of mise en sc�ne and the advent of CinemaScope... This is a fascinating and provocative book that casts a keen light on the ideas (and by extension, the films) of such astonishing <i>cin�astes</i> as Godard and Rivette, while also showing their affinities with the incisive thought of Andr� Bazin, the group&#x2019;s mentor... This collection deserves a wide readership among casual and committed filmgoers alike.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Christian Science Monitor</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t simply an anthology of interesting film criticism; it&#x2019;s something much more rare and intriguing&#x2015;the documentary history of an important intellectual shift...

Faith Fairchild was convinced she had seen pretty much everything. But the transplanted caterer/minister's wife was unprepared for the surprises awaiting her in the sleepy Massachusetts village of Aleford. And she is especially taken aback by the dead body of a pretty young thing she discovers stashed in the church's belfry. The victim, Cindy Shepherd. was well-known locally for her acid tongue and her jilted beaux, which created a lot of bad blood and more than a few possible perpetrators -- including her luckless fiance, who had neither an alibi nor a better way to break off the engagement. Faith thinks it's terribly unfair that the police have zeroed in on the hapless boyfriend, and so she sets out to uncover the truth. But digging too deeply into the sordid secrets of a small New England village tends to make the natives nervous. And an overly curious big city lady can become just another small town death statistic in very short order.</p></p><p><p>Katherine Hall Page is the author of twenty-three previous Faith Fairchild mysteries, the first of which received the Agatha Award for best first mystery. <em>The Body in the Snowdrift</em> was honored with the Agatha Award for best novel of 2006.

Jackson turned in his Boston badge to retire to the idyllic isle. And that's what makes a six-month-old murder so troubling to the perplexed locals. But Jackson's got troubles of his own -- including a loving wife, Zee, who's becoming curiously distant ... and the arrival of a mysterious visitor who's searching for a valuable set of stolen statues, and who's certain J.W.'s the man to hunt them down. It's an assignment that plunges the fisherman/chef-cum-private investigator into an unfamiliar milieu: the Vineyard's cutthroat world of art aficionados. And suddenly J.W. finds himself pitted against some of the island's most powerful and unscrupulous figures, uncovering lethal threads that may connect an unsolved mutilation/slaying with those who would stop at nothing -- including murder -- to add rare forbidden objects to their collections.</p></p><p><p>Philip R. Craig grew up on a small cattle ranch near Durango, Colorado, before going off to college at Boston University, where he was an All-American fencer. He earned his M.F.A. at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. A recently retired professor of English at Wheelock College in Boston, he and his wife Shirley now live year-round on Martha's Vineyard.</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> Later I figured I got involved, and almost killed, for three reasons: the money, the case itself, and Zee's uncharacteristic detachment from the world we shared. </p><p> If you live on Martha's Vineyard you can always use more money, and the job interested me because it concerned works of art whose history caught my fancy. Most of all, though, I probably agreed to work for Mahsimba because, during an especially warm and lovely spring, Zee had become curiously spellbound and ethereal, like a teenaged girl. </p><p> Her dreaminess had continued on into June and had disconnected her from our normal family life. She was as efficient as ever at her work in the emergency room at the hospital, but she seemed lost in obscure thoughts when at home with the children and me, as though she were seeing the world with the eyes of one who had once been blind. </p><p> I had several thoughts about the cause of this, none having anything to do with the others. Perhaps she had relapsed into guilt over killing a Boston thug the year before, even though she'd done it to save herself and our daughter and had taken a gunshot in the process. Or maybe it was a sort of sustained spring fever. Or maybe she was experiencing some form of the seven-year itch. That wouldn't be too surprising, considering my own certainty of my limitations as a husband. But when I asked her the cause of her sea change, she only pressed her forefinger to my lips and wordlessly shook her head. </p><p> Whatever the cause of her enchantment, there seemed to be nothing I could do about it, so I determined to remain unchanged myself, to stay the man whose love had once given her joy, and to hope that it still did or would again, however dreamily removed from me she seemed to be for the nonce. When Mahsimba came into my life I was glad to accept a job that would oblige me to think of something else. </p><p> Before the phone rang, I was alone in the house. Zee was at work, the kids were in school, and the cats were off catting somewhere outside. I was finishing my morning coffee and reading the <i>Vineyard Gazette's</i> sixth-months-later story about the Headless Horseman. </p><p> That still-unidentified body had long since been placed in some mainland morgue or grave, but on the Vineyard its notoriety had lessened only slightly since the previous December, when an understandably shocked pony rider had discovered it beside a frosty bridle path up in West Tisbury. The equestrian connection explained half of the corpse's nickname, and its missing head accounted for the other half. It could have been called the Handless Horseman, for that matter, because the hands were missing, too, along with the corpse's clothes. </p><p> Naked, headless, and handless corpses are not common on Martha's Vineyard, especially in the dead of winter, so locally the discovery had caused quite a stir. Speculation swirled about who had died and why and who had done the deed, and there was much conjecture that someone with a horse was involved since that was clearly how the body had been transported along the trail. Unfortunately for the police, there are many horses and riders on the island and not one of them seemed the type to kill and behead people. </p><p> The how was easier; the man, white and in his forties, according to medical reports, had been shot right in the pump with what appeared to be a .38- or .40-caliber bullet. Before this happened, he had apparently been in good physical condition, but that was about all anyone had learned about him. He didn't fit any of the missing person reports that the police had received, and now, half a year later, he was as unknown as ever. </p><p> The <i>Gazette</i> report, consistent with that famous newspaper's policy of not emphasizing the island's darker side, was short and on a middle page, and contented itself with a brief review of the facts and of the questions that people still talked about: Who was the guy and who had killed him and why? </p><p> These questions continued to bother those of the island's citizens who didn't like the idea that they might be sharing their beloved Vineyard with a killer. I, however, was not one of the worriers, because it had been a long time since I'd thought that my island home actually was akin to Eden before the Fall. My Vineyard, for all its fabled loveliness, had its share of snakes living under the rocks. </p><p> But I had not moved to the island to get involved with such creatures. I had done enough of that during five years on the Boston PD. The bullet I still carried next to my spine as a consequence of wearing a shield had only been the last factor that led me to decide to let somebody else save the world. I had better things to do. </p><p> That very day, for example, I had veggie and flower gardens to tend, floors to vacuum, supper to prepare, a leak in my waders that I had to find and patch, another leak in the ceiling of the porch that I had to track down and fix, clothes to wash, shopping to do, and, most important, fishing to attend to. For the bluefish had been in for a couple of weeks, and I still had more of them to catch. </p><p> Ordinarily I could think of little that was more pleasurable than being on the beach doing battle with the blues, and this year fishing was doubly appealing because it also served to distract me from fretting about Zee. </p><p> I was just beginning to fret some more when Stanley Crandel phoned. </p><p> "J.W., that you?" </p><p> "Stanley, where are you? Up at the house?" </p><p> "No. London. Just got here from Africa. Went from Cape Town to Cairo. Terrific trip! That's what I'm calling about. Met this man in Harare. Interesting fellow. Seems he's going to the Vineyard. I wonder if you'll show him around, help him out." </p><p> "When's he coming?" </p><p> "He may be there already. I put him in touch with John Skye, and he'll be staying at John's place because Betsy and I won't get down to our place until later." </p><p> "What's he need me for?" </p><p> "It's a long story, and this call's costing me a fortune. He'll explain it when he sees you. Will you meet him?" </p><p> "Well..." </p><p> "You'll be doing me a favor." </p><p> I hate it when people say that. "All right," I said. </p><p> "I knew I could depend on you, J.W. I told him to call you from John's house when he gets in. His name's Mahsimba. Thanks. Gotta go." </p><p> The phone clicked and buzzed in my ear. </p><p> I shook my head at the thought of a phone call being too expensive for Stanley Crandel to bear. Stanley and his wife, Betsy, owned one of the biggest houses on East Chop, where Crandels had been summering for a hundred years. Stanley liked to think that he was a descendant of John Saunders, the onetime Virginia slave who, some said, was later the first Methodist preacher on the Vineyard. But it had been a long time since Stanley's line of Crandels had been slaves to anything but high finance. </p><p> This fact notwithstanding, it was typical of Stanley and Betsy simultaneously to be generous to friends, family, and charities, and yet to squeeze their pennies till they screamed. Maybe they had so many pennies precisely because they pinched them so hard. Maybe that was true of all wealthy people, including the other aristocratic and upper-middle-class African-American citizens of Oak Bluffs. I wouldn't know, being an outsider to such social circles. </p><p> I knew Stanley and Betsy because I opened their house in the spring, closed it again in the fall, and looked after it all year long. I'd gotten the job because Stanley and John Skye had gone to college together and John had given Stanley my name. I also opened and closed John's place and cared for it while he and his family were up in Weststock during the winter, where he professed things medieval at the college. I tended to other houses, too, because when you have no steady job, you have to be willing to do a lot of things. </p><p> And now, apparently, I was going to have yet another bit of work: showing Mr. Mahsimba around the Vineyard and helping him achieve whatever he had in mind. </p><p> I thought of John Skye and his family, and was glad I'd gotten the farm ready for their arrival. The twins were now in college, so they'd be getting out of school at the same time as their father did. Thus, all of the Skyes might be descending from America any day now. I presumed that John would arrive before Mr. Mahsimba did. I wondered what Mr. Mahsimba's long story would be, but there was no way to guess. </p><p> I went back to perusing the <i>Gazette.</i> Since I'd taken the phone call, the Headless Horseman was still unidentified, and the case was still open as unsolved murder cases always are. I thought about the Woman in the Dunes, over on Cape Cod. There were similarities between her case and that of the Horseman. The woman's handless body had been found years before in the sand dunes, her jeans folded neatly beside her. She was still unidentified after many years. A very cold case, but one that was still open. </p><p> The latest effort at identifying her involved opening the grave and attempting DNA tests, which hadn't been available when she'd first been found. I imagined that DNA evidence had also been taken from the Horseman, but that nothing had been done with it because of the absence of comparable samples. </p><p> I put the paper down, stopped thinking about crime, finished my coffee, and considered the many things that needed doing. An old guy once told me that the good part about being retired is that you still have lots of things to do but you don't have to do them. I wasn't quite retired, so I still had to do them, but I had some choices about when and in which order. </p><p> So I went fishing. </p><p> It was still early enough in the season for Norton Point Beach to be open, so I went that way, over the sand from Katama toward Chappy. Soon impassioned Department of Fish and Wildlife agents would close Norton Point to ORV traffic on the grounds that passing trucks disturbed nesting and fledging plovers. It was one of those governmental decisions that explains anarchism, since the real threats to plovers, as even the beach-closers knew, were gulls, skunks, and other wild predators. Maddening. When I'm king, I'm shipping all of the plovers and environmentalists to No Man's Land, where they can care for one another and not bother the rest of us. The world will thank me for it. </p><p> I stopped here and there and made casts into the light southwest wind. I caught nothing, but that was okay, because it was a lovely early June day, with bright sun and a clear light blue sky arching down and meeting the dark blue ocean on the southern horizon. If you sailed that way, the first land you'd come to would be Hispaniola, which was well beyond my longest cast. </p><p> I fished awhile at Metcalf's Hole and got one lone five-pound blue which apparently had no friends. I cut his throat, rinsed him off, and put him on the ice in the fish box, then went on to Wasque. </p><p> Wasque Point is the southeastern corner of Chappaquiddick, the peninsula hooked to the rest of the Vineyard by Norton Point Beach. When the water broke through the beach between the ocean and Katama Bay, Chappy became an island and remained one until Neptune in his wisdom closed the opening again. Wasque is one of the best places in the world to catch bluefish, because of the tides that form the Wasque rip, where bait is tossed about and the blues go after it. When conditions are right you can slaughter the blues at Wasque. </p><p> They weren't perfect that morning, but they were good enough, and the surf casters who were stretched in a line along the beach in front of their four-by-fours were busy and happy. I became one of them, and when I finally broke off and went home, the blues were still there, hitting almost anything you threw, filling the air with the scent of watermelon. </p><p> In town I sold all of my fish but one and took that one home. On the filleting table behind our shed I scaled and filleted the fish and then took the fillets into the house and put them in the fridge. We'd have stuffed bluefish for supper. Delish! My mouth was already watering. </p><p> It was a little past noon and I was having my first Sam Adams of the day when the phone rang again. </p><p> John Skye's voice was on the other end. "The groves of academe have shed the Skyes for another summer," said John. "We're here." </p><p> "If I'd known that a little earlier, I'd have brought you a bluefish." </p><p> "I can catch my own bluefish, thanks. Are you busy right now?" </p><p> "I'm drinking a beer, but it won't take long to finish it." </p><p> "Fine. Come on over. There's someone I want you to meet. His name is Mahsimba." </p><p> Copyright � 2002 by Philip R.

The product of a colloquium at Harvard&#39;s Center for Hellenic Studies, this volume offers a broadly based, comparative examination of war and military organization in their complex interactions with social, economic, and political structures as well as cultural practices.</p><p>Kurt A. Raaflaub is Professor of Classics and History at Brown University, and Joint Director of the Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, D.C..Thucydides and his contemporaries knew war from bitter experience. Peace to them was an illusion, war the true constant...<i>War and Society in the Ancient and Medieval World</i> shows how and why Thucydides's vision prevailed throughout pre-industrial times in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. Because of the omnipresence of war or its specter within ancient Greek--and Roman--culture, editors Kurt Raaflaub and Nathan Rosenstein recognize the real need to explore in theoretical terms how war (including military technology and organization) affected ancient society (including economic and political systems) and vice versa. (Thomas Palaima <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i> 2000-12-01)<br><br>The editors have sought to produce a book about the social history of war in the pre-industrial age. They have encouraged their contributors to write not about army organization, battles, tactics, and so on, but about the social and political context of war, and about the interrelationship between war and the institutional structures of the various states which are surveyed. The result...is a volume of broad scope with much potential for comparison and cross-fertilization. It certainly comes across as a work of solid scholarship and interesting insights which should appeal to a wide audience.

It put me in touch with family members who were willing to tell the end-of-life stories of their loved ones. It also allowed me to describe in detail the &nbsp;"good deaths" of two of my siblings. I tried to keep in the forefront the needs of surviving family members keeping in mind that the way a person dies lives on in the memory of those that live on. An additional underlying theme arises out of the need to plan for <i>my </i>good death in view of my shortened life expectancy. This book became both necessary and practical for me.<b>As a</b> <b>medical doctor </b>in the U.S. and India for five decades, and as someone who almost died several times from heart illness, Glen Miller has done his homework on preparing to die. Living and dying are entwined. Miller's book rivets the reader's attention with his and others' stories. Readers will be torn between not wanting to stop and needing to stop because of the emotional and content depth. Preparing for death, in the ways Miller instructs us, will make our dying easier for loved ones who survive. This book is important for family and church discussion. Each chapter ends with discussion questions; it con�cludes with a checklist of tasks to set one's "house in order." <br> --<b>Willard Swartley</b>, professor emeritus of New Testament at Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Readable, realistic, and spiritually relevant</b>, this book is for anyone coping with chronic illness or aging care issues, who yearns for the opportunity to die a "good death." Dr. Miller navigates the choppy waters of health care in ways that preserve personal dignity, maintain a sense of control, preserve moral and spiritual values, and generate loving and sustaining memories. <br> --<b>Clair Hochstetler</b>, manager of chaplaincy and pastoral care at the Canberra Hospital, Australian Capital Territory<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>In a world where the reality of death may be denied or resisted </b>through futile and expensive effort, we need a book that provides a realistic and healthy per�spective on this universal experience. Glen Miller has written that book. Using facts, figures, and especially stories, he addresses the legal, physical, and emotional aspects of dying to help us see death, and especially our preparation for it, in a positive way. This book is an inviting and useful guide to specific actions we can take to make our death what we want it to be. --<b>Joseph Longacher</b>, MD, past president of Mennonite Medical Association, and past president of medical staff at Henrico Doctors Hospital, Richmond, Virginia <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>With good humor and frank honesty</b>, experienced physician Dr. Glen E. Miller explores healthy living and dying in Living Thoughtfully, Dying Well. Poignant stories of others' end-of-life experiences accompany Dr. Miller's recounting of his own nearly fatal third heart attack. Readers will be challenged with the inevitable issues they must prepare for as they face the physical, emotional, and spiritual transitions of aging. This is a must-read for families and church communities. <br> --<b>Ruth Lapp Guengerich</b>, MEd, mental health counselor, codirector of Mennonite Women USA <br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>Have you ever wished </b>that you could talk with a family member about dying? Glen Miller provides reflective stories about his health journey, factual informa�tion about preparing for death, delightful humor, and thoughtful suggestions for conversation. Questions to guide discussions can be found at the end of every chapter. This book could facilitate conversations about choices and a good death by families or friends. <br> --<b>Mary J. Dyck</b>, associate professor at Mennonite College of Nursing, Illinois State University <br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>As a member of a monastic community </b>I appreciate so much Dr. Miller's expertise and approach to the issue of thinking ahead to one's death. In his Rule for Monasteries, Saint Benedict urges monastics to "keep death daily before one's eyes." As communities we are intentional about having members die "at home," surrounded by caring community members. This book is writ�ten in a warm, accessible manner, with stories and anecdotes bringing the major points into contact with the human situation. Each chapter concludes with questions that will draw the engaged reader into reflection and, hopefully, decision making and action. Miller argues in a convincing manner that it is pos�sible and desirable to have a "good death" which truly integrates one's deepest human, spiritual beliefs. <br> --<b>Abbot John Klassen</b>, Order of Saint Benedict, Saint</p><h2>Waiting for Wednesday: A Frieda Klein Mystery</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Another compelling entry in this complex, suspenseful series.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist </i>(starred review)</b><br><br>In the third volume of the bestselling Frieda Klein Mystery series, the brilliant but troubled London psychotherapist returns&#x2014;only to journey into a darkness from which there may be no return.&nbsp;<br><br>Ruth Lennox, mother of three, is found dead in a pool of her own blood.

This is the first book in English to interweave the Agni Yoga writings and the Roerichs&#39; relationship with their spiritual teacher in with their fascinating travels, disclosing the long-hidden story of the Roerichs&#39; connection with Tibetan Buddhism. Though it may read like a tale, Drayer takes us on the real-life adventures of the Roerichs as they travel to the most remote and dangerous regions of India, China, Mongolia, the Gobi, Tibet and Siberia. We bear witness as the couple flees the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 Russia and as they arrive in New York City in the fall of 1920 where they later founded the first school that teaches all of the arts under one roof.

Jan's twin children, gifted with prophecy, show him how to render the unicorns immune to the poison of wyverns, the white serpents who drove them from the Hallow Hills four centuries ago. This is the sign Jan has awaited; it is time for the unicorns to attempt a return. But first, he must track down his mad sire, king-turned-renegade Korr, who reveals that the rightful unicorn leader should be Jan's mate, the female warrior Tek. Shocked by Korr's disclosure and its implications for his personal happiness, Jan wanders through the wilderness, discovering unlooked-for allies. Meanwhile, Tek marshals their tribe for its journey to the Hallow Hills, where a final battle takes place and all the unicorn prophecies regarding the Firebringer ultimately come true. Filled with action and drama, this is a deeply satisfying adventure that succeeds in uniting the various subplots of the trilogy's earlier installments into a smoothly connected whole. Jan, once an impetuous youngster, has matured into a wise, brave hero; Tek proves herself once again to be a fitting mate and leader in her own right. Other characters, both new and old, masterfully assist in moving the plot along.

With little available capital or labor, here's how: high-pressure water cannons washed hillsides into sluices that used mercury to trap gold but let the soil wash away; eventually more than three times the amount of earth moved to make way for the Panama Canal entered California's rivers, leaving behind twenty tons of mercury every mile&#x2015;rivers overflowed their banks and valleys were flooded, the land poisoned. In the rush to wealth, the same chain of foreseeable consequences reduced California's forests and grasslands.</p><p>Not since William Cronon's<i> Nature's Metropolis</i> has a historian so skillfully applied John Muir's insight&#x2015;"When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe"&#x2015;to the telling of the history of the American West. Beautifully told, this is western environmental history at its finest.</p></p><p><p><b>Andrew C. Isenberg </b>is a professor of history at Temple University. He is the author of <i>The Destruction of the Bison: An Environmental History, 1750&#x2013;1920 </i>and is a former fellow of the Huntington Library and the Shelby Cullom Davis Center for Historical Studies.</p>Isenberg's densely written text provides an overview of the industrialization of mining, logging, ranching and agriculture in California between 1850 and 1900 that, while well researched and exceedingly informative, assumes a greater familiarity with North American and California history than most readers are likely to have. However, Isenberg provides a perspective almost entirely missing from other history texts, showing how our forebears' environmental decisions continue to affect our lives. He examines how technologies developed to mine the gold deposits of the Sierra Nevada, to log the redwoods of the Northwest coast and to develop the Central Valley into a productive agricultural region caused profound environmental changes that altered the course of industrialization and politics. Of particular interest is the role that hydraulic mining played in starting the "water wars" that have pervaded Western politics for the past 150 years. He makes a strong case that California, rapidly industrialized before any other Western state, set the model for industrial development in the American West. Most interestingly, he compares the sequestration of Native Americans in reservations and the rise of industrial-scale agriculture to the enclosure of British commons in preceding centuries. The extensive bibliography is rich in primary source material, and the text is thoroughly footnoted. This is not a book for the general reader; rather, it is best suited for an upper-division or graduate-level seminar course. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ever masterful, Dudjom Rinpoche, whose life and work provided a brilliant example of a Tibetan rigzin's full awareness, tells a group of yogis how to use an extended period of seclusion in a mountain hermitage to recognize the nature of mind in the Dzogchen tradition. In this instruction, he is down to earth and eminently practical. But also in a short but seminal exposition of the Dzogchen view, he delivers the nature of mind as if pointing at it in front of us. Dudjom Rinpoche places himself amongst the great masters of the Tibetan language and great yogis of the Dzogchen tradition, along with Longchenpa and Jigme Lingpa, in this classical exposition of Dzogchen. It is important to note that as Keith Dowman mentions in his preface, this brilliant text of Dudjom Rinpoche Jigtral Yeshe Dorje (1904 &#x2013; 1987) is cast in the mold where Dzogchen is inseparable from the Vajrayana of the Ngajur Nyingma tradition. Here Dzogchen is bound up with Tibetan Buddhism, which carries it and forms a basis for its practice. As an introduction to the text, Keith Dowman adds recollections of his interaction with his Guru as a preface to a eulogy contributed by Sogyal Rinpoche, which adds immeasurably to the background of the text.</p><p>Keith Dowman is a translator and teacher of Dzogchen, the quintessence of Buddhism. A student of the great Dzogchen lamas Dudjom Rinpoche and Kanjur Rinpoche, he lived in Benares, India, and Kathmandu, Nepal, for 50 years. His translations include Longchenpa&#x2019;s <i>Natural Perfection<i></i>, <i>Spaciousness<i></i> and <i>Maya Yoga<i></i>. As Chogyal Namkhai Norbu remarked, "In communion with many great masters he [Keith Dowman] has fortuitously absorbed the realization of Dzogchen."</i></i></i></p><h2>Fools&#39; Gold (3) (Order of Darkness)</h2><p>All that glitters may well be gold in the third book in the Order of Darkness series from #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Philippa Gregory.<br><br>Tasked to expose a coin counterfeiting scheme, Luca and Isolde travel to Venice just in time for Carnival.

The defenses were newly rebuilt; the city had just been occupied by its conquerors: the Venetians, who were spreading their unique form of government&#x2014;a republic&#x2014;through all the neighboring cities, fueled by gold, driven by trade. Slowly the little sally-port door opened and a guard in the bright livery of the victors presented arms and waited for the travelers to request admission.<br> <br>Freize launched himself into a mouthful of lies with ill-concealed relish. &#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; he said, gesturing to Luca. &#x201c;A young and wealthy nobleman from the west of Italy. His brother: a priest.&#x201d; He pointed to Brother Peter, who was indeed a priest but was serving as Luca&#x2019;s clerk and had never met him before they were partnered on this series of missions. &#x201c;His sister is the fair young lady.&#x201d; Freize gestured to the beautiful girl who was Lady Isolde of Lucretili, no relation at all to the handsome young man but traveling with him for safety. &#x201c;And her companion the dark young lady is riding with her.&#x201d; Freize was nearest to the truth with this, for Ishraq had been Isolde&#x2019;s friend and companion from childhood; now they were exiled together from their home, looking for a way to return. &#x201c;While I am&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Servant?&#x201d; the guard interrupted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Factotum,&#x201d; Freize said, rolling the word around his mouth with quiet pride. &#x201c;I am their general factotum.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Going where?&#x201d; the guard demanded, putting out his hand for a letter that would describe them. Unblushingly, Freize produced the document sealed by Milord, the commander of their secret papal Order, which confirmed the lie that they were a wealthy young family going to Venice.<br> <br>&#x201c;To Venice,&#x201d; Freize said. &#x201c;And home again. God willing,&#x201d; he added piously.<br> <br>&#x201c;Purpose of visit?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Trade. My young master is interested in shipping and gold.&#x201d;<br> <br>The guard raised his eyebrows and shouted a command to the men inside the town. The great gate swung open as he stood deferentially to one side, bowing low as the party rode grandly inward.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do we tell lies here?&#x201d; Ishraq asked Freize very quietly, bringing up the rear as servants should. &#x201c;Why not wait till we get to Venice?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Too late there,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If Luca is going to pass for a wealthy young merchant in Venice, someone might ask after his journey. Someone may see us here at the inn. We can say we came from Ravenna. If they bother to enquire, they can confirm here that we are a wealthy family and hope that they won&#x2019;t trouble to look beyond, all the way from Pescara.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But if they do trace us back, beyond Pescara, to the village of Piccolo, then they&#x2019;ll learn that Luca is an inquirer, working for the Pope himself, and you are his friend, and Brother Peter his clerk, and Isolde and I are no relation at all but just young women traveling with you for safety on our way to Isolde&#x2019;s kinsman.&#x201d;<br> <br>Freize scowled. &#x201c;If we had known that Luca&#x2019;s master would have wanted him to travel disguised, we could have started this whole journey with new clothes, spending money like lords. But since he only condescended to inform us at Piccolo, we have to take the risk. I will buy us some rich elegant capes and hats here in Ravenna and we&#x2019;ll have to get the rest of our clothes in Venice.&#x201d;<br> <br>The guard pointed the way they should go, toward the best inn of the town, and they found it easily, a big building against the wall of the great castle, on the little hill above the market square. Freize jumped down from his horse and left him standing as he opened the door and bellowed for service for his master, then he came back out and held the horses while Luca, Lady Isolde and Brother Peter swept into the inn and ordered two private bedrooms and a private dining room, as befitted their great rank. Freize helped Ishraq down from her horse, and she went quickly after her mistress as Freize led all the horses and the pack donkey round to the stable yard.<br> <br>As they settled into their rooms they could hear the bells of the churches chiming for Vespers all over the city, the air loud with their clamor, birds whirling into the sky from the many towers. Isolde went to the window, rubbed the frost away from the panes, and watched Brother Peter and Luca leave the inn and head toward the church through the occasional swirls of light snow.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you going to church?&#x201d; Ishraq asked, surprised, as Isolde was usually very devout.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tomorrow morning,&#x201d; Isolde said. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t concentrate tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ishraq did not need to ask her friend why she was so distracted. She only watched her gaze follow the young man as he strode down the cobbled street.<br> <br><br> <br>When the men came back from Mass they all dined together in the private room, Freize bringing up food from the kitchen. When he had spread all the plates: the pie, the pitadine&#x2014;a sort of pancake with rich savory toppings&#x2014;the venison haunch, the roast ham, the braised chicken and the sweetbreads on the table, he stood by the door, the very picture of a deferential servant.<br> <br>&#x201c;Freize: eat with us,&#x201d; Luca commanded.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m supposed to be your general factotum,&#x201d; Freize repeated the grand word. &#x201c;Or servant.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No one can see,&#x201d; Isolde pointed out. &#x201c;And it feels odd when you don&#x2019;t sit down. I&#x2019;d like you to eat with us, Freize.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was no need for her to repeat the invitation. Freize pulled up a chair, took a plate and started to serve himself generously.<br> <br>&#x201c;Besides, this way you&#x2019;ll get two dinners,&#x201d; Ishraq pointed out to him with a little smile. &#x201c;One now, and one in the kitchen later.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A working man needs to keep up his strength,&#x201d; Freize said cheerfully, buttering a thick slice of bread and sinking his white teeth into it. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s Ravenna like?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Old,&#x201d; Luca remarked. &#x201c;The little that I have seen of it so far. A great city, wonderful churches, as beautiful as Rome in some parts. But before we leave tomorrow I want to go to the tomb of Galla Placidia.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Isolde asked him.<br> <br>&#x201c;She was a very great lady in ancient times, and she prepared herself a great tomb that the priest at church told me to go and see. He says it is very beautiful inside, with mosaics from floor to ceiling.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I should like to see that!&#x201d; Ishraq remarked and then flushed, anxious that Isolde would think that she was trying to get into Luca&#x2019;s company.<br> <br>As soon as Isolde saw her friend&#x2019;s embarrassment she blushed too and said quickly: &#x201c;Oh but you must go! Go with Luca while I pack our bags for the journey. Why don&#x2019;t the two of you go in the morning?&#x201d;<br> <br>Brother Peter looked from one red-cheeked girl to another as if they were troubling beings from another world altogether. &#x201c;What on earth is the matter with you now?&#x201d; he asked wearily.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you are to pass as my sister and Ishraq as your servant then you had both better come and see the tomb,&#x201d; Luca said, quite blind to the girls&#x2019; embarrassment. &#x201c;And surely Ishraq should always accompany you, Isolde, when you are walking around a strange city. You should always have a lady-in-waiting.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And in any case, we can&#x2019;t go halfway across Christendom with you two carrying on like this,&#x201d; Freize said gently.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why, what&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d; Luca looked from one to another, noticing their confusion for the first time. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br> <br>There was an awkward silence. &#x201c;We had a disagreement,&#x201d; Isolde said awkwardly. &#x201c;Before we left Piccolo. Actually, I was in the wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You two quarrel?&#x201d; Luca exclaimed. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve never known you to quarrel. What&#x2019;s it all about?&#x201d;<br> <br>Freize, who knew that they had quarreled over Luca, stepped into the silence. &#x201c;Lasses,&#x201d; he said generally to the table. &#x201c;Often upset about one thing or another. Highly strung. Like the little donkey. Think they know their own mind even when it&#x2019;s not quite right.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh don&#x2019;t be ridiculous!&#x201d; Ishraq said crossly. She turned to Isolde. &#x201c;I should want everything to be as it was between us, and anything else will work itself out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isolde, her eyes on the table, nodded her fair head. &#x201c;I am sorry,&#x201d; she said, her voice low. &#x201c;I was utterly wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all right then,&#x201d; Freize said with the air of a man having brought about a diplomatic compromise in a difficult situation. &#x201c;Glad I settled it. No need to thank me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You had better pray for patience,&#x201d; Brother Peter said crossly to the two girls. &#x201c;God knows that I have to.&#x201d; He rose from the table and went solemnly out of the room. As the door closed behind him the four young people exchanged rueful smiles.<br> <br>&#x201c;But what was the matter?&#x201d; Luca persisted.<br> <br>Freize shook his head at him, indicating he should be silent. &#x201c;Best left alone,&#x201d; he advised. &#x201c;Like the little donkey when it has finally settled itself down.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyway, it&#x2019;s over,&#x201d; Isolde ruled, &#x201c;and we should go to bed as well.&#x201d;<br> <br>As soon as she rose to her feet Luca held open the door for her and followed her out into the hall. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not upset with me, about anything?&#x201d; he asked her quietly.<br> <br>She shook her head. &#x201c;I was quite at fault with Ishraq. She told me that she had held you in her arms for comfort, when you were grieving, and I was angry with her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why would you be angry?&#x201d; he asked, though his heart hammered in his chest, hoping that he had guessed her answer.<br> <br>She raised her face and looked at him honestly, her dark blue eyes meeting his hazel ones. &#x201c;Alas, I was jealous,&#x201d; she said simply. He saw her little, rueful, smile. &#x201c;Jealous like a fool,&#x201d; she confessed.<br> <br>&#x201c;You were jealous that she held me in her arms?&#x201d; he said very low.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because you and I have never held each other close?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, we cannot,&#x201d; she reasoned. &#x201c;You are promised to the priesthood and I was born a lady. I can&#x2019;t go around kissing people. Not like Ishraq. She&#x2019;s free to behave as she wants.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you do want me to hold you?&#x201d; He stepped closer and whispered the question against her blonde hair, so that she could feel the warmth of his breath.<br> <br>She could not say the word, she merely leaned her head toward him.<br> <br>Very gently, very softly, as if he was afraid of startling her, Luca put one arm around her slim waist and the other round her shoulders and drew her close. Isolde rested her head on his shoulder and closed her eyes to savor the intense pleasure that rushed through her as she felt the length of his lithe body against her and the strength in his arms as they tightened around her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did she tell you I kissed her forehead?&#x201d; Luca whispered in her ear, delighting in the touch and the rose-water scent of this young woman he had desired since the moment that he had first seen her.<br> <br>She raised her head. &#x201c;She did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Were you jealous of that too?&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a gleam of mischief in his eyes, and she saw it at once and smiled back at him. &#x201c;Unfortunately, I was.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shall I kiss you as I kissed her? Would that make it fair?&#x201d;<br> <br>In answer she closed her eyes and raised her face to him. Luca longed to kiss her warm mouth but instead, obedient to his offer, he gently kissed her forehead, and had the satisfaction of feeling her sway, just slightly, in his arms, as if she too wanted for more.<br> <br>In a moment she opened her dark blue eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shall I kiss you on the lips?&#x201d; Luca asked her.<br> <br>It was a step too far. He sensed her flinch, and she leaned back so she could see his warmly smiling face.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think you should not,&#x201d; she said, but, in contradiction, her arms were still around his waist and she did not let him go. His arms held her close and she did not step back.<br> <br>Slowly, he leaned forward, slowly her eyes closed, and she raised her mouth to his. Behind them the door opened and Freize came out with the dishes from dinner. He checked himself when he saw the two of them, enwrapped in the darkened hall. &#x201c; &#x2019;Scuse me,&#x201d; he said cheerfully, and went past them to the kitchen.<br> <br>Luca rapidly released Isolde, who put her hands to her hot cheeks. &#x201c;I should go to bed,&#x201d; she said quietly. &#x201c;Forgive me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re not angry with Ishraq, nor upset with yourself anymore?&#x201d; he confirmed.<br> <br>She went to the stairs, but he could see that she was laughing. &#x201c;I scolded Ishraq like a fishwife!&#x201d; she confessed. &#x201c;I accused her of loose behavior for allowing your kiss. And now here am I!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll forgive you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And you will be happy again.&#x201d;<br> <br>She went up the stairs and turned back and smiled at him. He caught his breath at the luminous loveliness of her face. &#x201c;I am happy now,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I think I have never been as happy in my life as I am now.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>In the morning, as Freize went out to buy new and beautiful capes and hats for their sea voyage to Venice, Brother Peter and Luca&#x2014;holding to their pretense of being merchant brothers&#x2014;and Isolde and Ishraq&#x2014;as their sister and her companion&#x2014;went to walk in the town of Ravenna.<br> <br>It was a small city, tightly enclosed within the encircling walls, the great castle dominating the jumble of shabby roofs around the castle hill. The morning was bright and sunny, the early frost melting from the red-tiled roofs. Rising to the blue sky, at every street corner, were the tall bell towers of great churches. A shallow canal flowed into the very center of the town, where a market sold everything on the stone-built quay. The city had been the capital of the ancient kingdom, and the great stone roads running north and south and east and west across the whole of Italy crossed at the very heart of the old city.<br> <br>The two girls hesitated beside the great church that towered over the area, admiring the rose-colored brick. &#x201c;The church is what takes your eye, but the tomb I want to see is just here,&#x201d; Luca said, and led the way to a modest little building set to one side.<br> <br>&#x201c;This little place?&#x201d; Isolde ducked under the low opening; Ishraq followed her, Brother Peter behind her. The building was in the shape of a cross, and they entered by the north door. For a moment they paused at the entrance of the tiny church and then as Isolde crossed herself, and bent her knee, Luca exclaimed at the explosion of color inside the modest building.<br> <br>Every part of the arched interior was glistening, almost as if it had been freshly painted. The walls, the floor, even the curved ceilings were rich with bright mosaics. Isolde gazed around her in amazed delight; Ishraq could not take her eyes from the roof above their heads, which was deep-sea blue, studded with hundreds of golden stars. It was like a silk scarf sweeping over their heads and down into the arches on all four sides.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s beautiful!&#x201d; Ishraq exclaimed, thinking how similar it was to the rich designs of the Arab world. &#x201c;What is it? A private chapel?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a church at all, it&#x2019;s a mausoleum,&#x201d; Brother Peter told her. &#x201c;Built by a gr...</p><h2>Most of the Better Natural Things in the World: (Juvenile Fiction, Nature Book for Kids, Wordless Picture Book)</h2><p>A tiger carries a dining room chair on her back.

Alan Wallace delivers the long-awaited followup to his&nbsp;<i>Stilling the Mind: Shamatha Teachings from Dudjom Lingpa&#x2019;s Vajra Essence&nbsp;</i>(2011).</b><br><br><i>Fathoming the Mind</i> continues the commentary to Dudjom Lingpa&#x2019;s <i>Vajra Essence</i> that appeared in <i>Stilling the Mind</i>, daringly contextualizing Buddhist teachings on the Great Perfection as a revolutionary challenge to many contemporary beliefs. This companion volume stems from an oral commentary that B. Alan Wallace gave to the next section of the <i>Vajra Essence</i>, on the cultivation of contemplative insight, or <i>vipashyana</i>, that fathoms the nature of existence as a whole. Dudjom Lingpa&#x2019;s revelation consists of a fascinating dialogue that occurred during his pure vision of Samantabhadra, personification of primordial consciousness, manifesting as the youthful form of the Lake-born Vajra emanation of Padmasambhava, in dialogue with an entourage of bodhisattvas symbolizing various aspects of Dudjom Lingpa&#x2019;s mind.<br> <br> In continuing to reflect on Dudjom Lingpa&#x2019;s writings and their relevance to the modern world, Wallace was inspired to elaborate extensively on his original commentary. This book includes introductory essays and an afterword, which explore how the insights discussed here might contribute to yet a new &#x201c;contemplative revolution,&#x201d; one that would be as far-reaching in its implications as the scientific revolutions triggered by the discoveries of Galileo, Darwin, and Einstein.</p><p>Dynamic lecturer, progressive scholar, and one of the most prolific writers and translators of Tibetan Buddhism in the West, B. Alan Wallace continually seeks innovative ways to integrate Buddhist contemplative practices with Western science to advance the study of the mind. Dr. Wallace has taught Buddhist theory and meditation worldwide since 1976. Having devoted fourteen years to training as a Tibetan Buddhist monk, ordained by H. H. the Dalai Lama, he went on to earn an undergraduate degree in physics and the philosophy of science at Amherst College and a doctorate in religious studies at Stanford. He is the founder and president of the Santa Barbara Institute for Consciousness Studies.<i>&#x201c;Fathoming the Mind</i> lucidly focuses Buddhism&#x2019;s present-day encounter with modernity on one of the most potent possibilities: that cognitive science is poised on the threshold of major revolution and the Buddhist worldview offers a profound opportunity to expand into radically new and necessary territory. &nbsp;This book contains a map of what Buddhist teachings about mind and reality can offer contemporary science. And Alan Wallace, with his deep understanding of both physical science and Buddhist philosophy and practice, is an exceptional guide.&#x201d; Author: David E. Presti, University of California, Berkeley, author of Foundational Concepts in Neuroscience (W.W. Norton, 2016) and Mind Beyond Brain (Columbia University Press, 2018)<br><br>"This book invites us to enjoy an illuminating journey through the terrain of a classic Tibetan text on the nature and practice of insight meditation.&nbsp;<br> <br> Like an experienced trekking guide who knows the territory well, Alan Wallace points out features of the landscape with easeful erudition and the deft use of analogy. Along the way, he comes up with all sorts of useful tools and materials just when the reader needs them&#x2014;these being the words of Western scientists and philosophers, and Eastern sages and adepts, which he draws on with equal familiarity and adroitness." Author: Ajahn Amaro, abbot of Amaravati Buddhist Monastery, UK<br><br>"This is a fascinating book. Continuing his impressive unpacking of the legacy of Dudjom Lingpa, Alan Wallace has produced a fine contribution to the long history of oral commentary on source texts. His grasp of the subject matter is impressive, as is the way he weaves in references to Western thought and scientific inquiry that places Dudjom Lingpa&#x2019;s text in a more relevant context. I highly recommend this book to all who are serious about having a mind and working with it."

Soon after Colin Wilson became aware of this phenomena in the 1960s he wondered about its history and how its power could be harnessed, thus began a 40 year investigation. In &#34;SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS&#34; we see how such luminaries as Yeats, Blake, Satre, Nietzche and Robert Graves were all effected by PE&#39;s and how on the opposite side it has long been noted that we are least insightful when we are at our lowest ebb. By looking in detail through the different areas where this phenomena has occurred and offering anecdotes and examples of how many people in history (as well as himself) were effected Wilson reveals a pattern of insight with emotions. He ends the book with an instructional section on achieving power consciousness for yourself.</p><p>Colin Wilson is a highly respected and erudite writer.

She is the author of the national bestseller,&nbsp;<i>The Saddlemaker's Wife&nbsp;</i>and the Agatha Award-winning Benni Harper Mysteries.A fourth appearance for Benni Harper (Kansas Troubles, 1996, etc.), curator of the Folk Art Museum in San Celina, California- -recently married to the town's Chief of Police Gabe Ortiz--who's now deep in preparations for the museum's first storytelling festival, to be combined with a show of handmade quilts. It's Benni's misfortune to discover the murdered body of Nora Cooper, a storyteller at the local library. Nora's brother Nick is head reference librarian there, under director Jillian Sinclair, a niece of the library's chief benefactor, Constance Sinclair. Nora, meanwhile, was involved in a bitter divorce settlement with soon- to-be-ex-husband Roy, who lives with girlfriend Grace Winter, a stableowner. They're Gabe's prime suspects until it's revealed that Nora was the author of the Tattler, an unsigned scandal-mongering column in the town's newspaper. It seems both library and museum staffs are chock-full of people with nasty secrets Nora was busy unearthing. Gabe works hard to restrain Benni's rampant investigating instincts--with good reason, as it turns out in the out-of-left-field, unsatisfying denouement. Much time is spent on Gabe and Benni's cluttered domestic life as they play reluctant hosts to Gabe's troubled son Sam, Benni's beloved but trying grandmother Dove and flighty cousin Rita--a setup as overpopulated, artificial, and unconvincing as the murder mystery. Quilters and storytelling enthusiasts may find some joy here; others will find this one heavy on chitchat but low on substance. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

However, youth ministry expert Andrew Root explains that this focus is central to Bonhoeffer&#39;s story and thought. Root presents Bonhoeffer as the forefather and model of the growing theological turn in youth ministry. By linking contemporary youth workers with this epic theologian, the author shows the depth of youth ministry work and underscores its importance in the church. He also shows how Bonhoeffer&#39;s life and thought impact present-day youth ministry practice.</p><p><b>"A compelling addition to the literature on both youth ministry and Bonhoeffer"<br></b><br>"<i>Bonhoeffer as Youth Worker</i> reads like the labor of love that it is, introducing Bonhoeffer as a fellow pastor who shares your passion for young people's journey of faith and your conviction that Christ's church should receive youth without using them.

In May 1970, Marcos P. S. Arruda, a young political activist, was seized in S�o Paulo, imprisoned, and tortured. <i>A Mother&#x2019;s Cry</i> is the harrowing story of Marcos&#x2019;s incarceration and his family&#x2019;s efforts to locate him and obtain his release. Marcos&#x2019;s mother, Lina Penna Sattamini, was living in the United States and working for the U.S. State Department when her son was captured. After learning of his arrest, she and her family mobilized every resource and contact to discover where he was being held, and then they launched an equally intense effort to have him released. Marcos was freed from prison in 1971. Fearing that he would be arrested and tortured again, he left the country, beginning eight years of exile.<p></p><p>Lina Penna Sattamini describes her son&#x2019;s tribulations through letters exchanged among family members, including Marcos, during the year that he was imprisoned. Her narrative is enhanced by Marcos&#x2019;s account of his arrest, imprisonment, and torture. James N. Green&#x2019;s introduction provides an overview of the political situation in Brazil, and Latin America more broadly, during that tumultuous era. In the 1990s, some Brazilians began to suggest that it would be best to forget the trauma of that era and move on. Lina Penna Sattamini wrote her memoir as a protest against historical amnesia. First published in Brazil in 2000, <i>A Mother&#x2019;s Cry</i> is testimonial literature at its best. It conveys the experiences of a family united by love and determination during years of political repression.</p></p><p>&#34;A family&#39;s chance descent into the indignities of Brazil&#39;s military dictatorship is uncompromisingly recorded in nearly a decade of letters penned across continents; so too is the inextinguishable hope to set free a son, grandson, and brother. Arbitrarily imprisoned, brutally tortured, and subsequently whisked abroad to safety, Marcos P. S. Arruda would then face years of difficult rehabilitation. His is the tale of many a political prisoner; but, fortunate to escape with his life, he has ever since borne witness against the oppression, corruption, and brutality of authoritarian regimes, their supporters, and their protectors the world over.&#34;--Ralph Della Cava, Columbia University<p>Lina Penna Sattamini, a former freelance interpreter with the U.S. State Department, lives in Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>James N. Green is Professor of Brazilian History and Culture at Brown University.</p></p><h2>The Revelatory Text: Interpreting the New Testament as Sacred Scripture, Second Edition</h2><p><p>In this new edition of her major study of the New Testament, Sandra Schneiders proposes a comprehensive hermeneutical theory for New Testament interpretation, which takes full account of the Bible as both sacred Scripture and as a historical-literary classic. Designed to spur reflection on the role of Scripture as revelatory text in the life of the Church and in the lives of individual believers, <i>The Revelatory Text</i> shows that an integral hermeneutical theory can ground a transformational hermeneutical praxis to make the biblical text available as a faith resource to the oppressed as well as to the privileged. </p> <p>Schneiders investigates the meaning of the theological claim that the Bible is the Word of God" and the "Church's book," along with the implications of these claims for biblical interpretation. She then examines the historical, literary, and religious-spiritual dimensions of the New Testament, highlighting the implications for interpretation theory and methodology, and concludes by putting her theory to the test in a feminist interpretation of John 4. </p> <p>The author argues that the comprehensive object of biblical interpretation is not merely information but transformation. She suggests that an adequate hermeneutical theory must include a wide range of exegetical and critical methods within a theologically and philosophically adequate understanding of Scripture as sacred text. She writes specifically to educated believers who wonder how sound biblical criticism can be incorporated into a faith- filled reading of the New Testament; biblical scholars who struggle with the question of whether or how faith can function legitimately in biblical scholarship; and those whose task it is to teach and preach the faith that looks to the New Testament as source and norm. </p> <p>Chapters are "The Problem and Project of New Testament Interpretation," "The New Testament as Word of God," "The New Testament as the Church's Book," "The World Behind the Test: History, Imagination, and the Revelatory Text," "The World of the Text: Witness, Language, and the Revelatory Text," "The World Before the Text: Meaning, Appropriation, and the Revelatory Text," and "A Case Study: Feminist Interpretation of John 4:1- 42."</p> <p> <i>Sandra M. Schneiders, IHM, is professor of New Testament studies and Christian spirituality at the Jesuit School of Theology and the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California.</i></p>"</p><p>This major contribution to the study of the <i>Bible</i> shows that interpretation of the New Testament as religious literature is vital to understanding the authentic nature of the texts.Sandra M. Schneiders, IHM, is professor emerita in the Jesuit School of Theology of Santa Clara University at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California.

As if she didn&#x2019;t already have my complete attention. <br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m watching,&#x201d; I assured her. <br> <br>She ran and began doing cartwheels across the backyard before flipping backward into what I now knew was called a back handspring. My baby girl was a little gymnast, and with that came a lot of practices. But every time she beamed at me and said, &#x201c;Daddy, watch this!&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t think of anything else I&#x2019;d rather watch. <br> <br>The past two and a half years of being my little girl&#x2019;s daddy had been some of the best years of my life. Only one other smile moved me as much as Daisy May&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Trisha stepped out the back door, smiling at me, with two glasses of lemonade in her hands. That smile was the other one that owned me. Daisy May had become my little girl a few years ago, but Trisha had been my girl for much longer. I had been entranced by the teenager who wouldn&#x2019;t give me the time of day, and completely captivated by the woman she had become. <br> <br>She was the best mother in the world if you asked Daisy May, Brent, or Jimmy. She was the most incredible woman in the world if you asked me. And she knew damn well we all adored her. <br> <br>&#x201c;You nailed that, Daisy, baby,&#x201d; Trisha cheered, and Daisy May instantly lit up. Our little girl had lived the first seven years of her life without the love of a mother. The woman who had given life to our children hadn&#x2019;t been able to love anyone. She&#x2019;d been angry and bitter and had neglected not only the children we now claimed as our own but her oldest son too&#x2014;one of my best friends, Preston Drake. He&#x2019;d been the only love these kids had known until their mother overdosed, leaving them in need of a home. Preston had been ready to take his younger siblings in, but Trisha and I had fallen in love with all of them. When we&#x2019;d asked him to let us adopt the kids, he had agreed. He&#x2019;d wanted them to have a home life with parents who loved them. Something he had never experienced. <br> <br>They all worshipped the ground Preston walked on. He was still their older brother, and he watched them every Thursday night and any other time Trisha and I needed a night out alone. It was a family unit that worked. <br> <br>I was one lucky son of a bitch. <br> <br>&#x201c;Momma, do you think I&#x2019;ll make the team next week?&#x201d; Daisy May asked as Trisha handed her a glass of lemonade. <br> <br>&#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ve worked hard and you have as good a chance as anyone. But no matter what happens, you are number one to us.&#x201d; <br> <br>Like always, Trisha knew the right answer to everything, and Daisy May beamed at her. <br> <br>&#x201c;Preston said he would be there,&#x201d; Daisy May said, plopping down on the grass beside me. <br> <br>&#x201c;Then he will be. You know he wouldn&#x2019;t miss your tryouts for anything,&#x201d; I replied, taking the glass Trisha held out for me&#x2014;then pulling her down onto my lap. I liked having my woman in my lap. Always had. <br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m nervous,&#x201d; Daisy May added, then took a sip. <br> <br>Trisha reached over and pulled Daisy toward us and tucked her under her arm. &#x201c;We will be right there cheering you on. You&#x2019;ve worked hard, and no matter what happens, you will be our star. We will be so proud of what you&#x2019;ve accomplished. Most of those girls have been taking gymnastics since they were very young. You&#x2019;ve managed to get a chance at the team in only two years! That right there is a reason to be proud.&#x201d; <br> <br>I loved this woman. She could make anyone feel better. I was sitting out here, getting nervous thinking about Daisy May trying out to make the competitive team, and Trisha wasn&#x2019;t making just Daisy feel better&#x2014;my nerves were easing too. <br> <br>Truth was, I didn&#x2019;t like the idea of anyone telling my baby girl no. But Trisha kept reminding me I couldn&#x2019;t fight all their battles in life. It was so damn hard, though. They&#x2019;d suffered enough in their earlier years. <br> <br>&#x201c;Next week I get to be a flower girl again,&#x201d; Daisy said, grinning up at us. She didn&#x2019;t stay focused on one thing too long. She was already thinking about Preston and Amanda&#x2019;s wedding. <br> <br>&#x201c;You have several weddings coming up. But I imagine next week&#x2019;s is the one you&#x2019;re most excited about,&#x201d; Trisha said, ruffling Daisy May&#x2019;s brown curls. <br> <br>&#x201c;Yep! I can&#x2019;t wait. Amanda said me and Brent and Jimmy get to all stand up there with them when they say their . . . uh . . . them things they say. I forgot what it&#x2019;s called.&#x201d; <br> <br>Trisha leaned back against me as I chuckled. &#x201c;While they say their vows,&#x201d; I said, and Daisy May nodded. <br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it. We get to stand up there. And Jimmy gets to hand Preston the ring. The one he puts on Amanda&#x2019;s finger. And I get to give Amanda the surprise . . .&#x201d; Daisy&#x2019;s eyes got big and she shut her mouth. <br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Trisha asked before I could. <br> <br>Daisy May shook her head and grinned, then twisted an imaginary lock on her lips and tossed away an equally imaginary key. <br> <br>Apparently, Preston had some kind of secret only Daisy May knew about. <br> <br>&#x201c;Well, now I&#x2019;m even more anxious for the wedding,&#x201d; Trisha said as she sank farther into me. My arms were wrapped around her waist, and I was beginning to think about where I&#x2019;d like to move my hands. My wife was smoking hot. She always had been. It never got old seeing her in a pair of tiny shorts and a tank top. This body could stop traffic. <br> <br>Our fifth wedding anniversary was coming up in four months. I had already prepared Preston that I&#x2019;d need his help. I intended to take her somewhere special. We&#x2019;d never had a real wedding. We couldn&#x2019;t afford one. But I had been desperate to make her mine. Back then I kept thinking she&#x2019;d figure out she could do better and leave me. When I had convinced her to go to the courthouse and become mine forever, I hadn&#x2019;t thought about the fairy-tale wedding she deserved. I had just wanted Trisha. <br> <br>It was time my woman had the fairy-tale wedding she deserved right before we went on the honeymoon we&#x2019;d never gotten. <br> <br>The first time I&#x2019;d seen her, she had taken my breath away. Getting her attention had been one hell of a ride. She&#x2019;d been so determined to stay away from me. Or any man. Then I&#x2019;d found out why . . . and I&#x2019;d sworn to myself she&#x2019;d never have to live in fear again.<br> <br>Falling in love with Trisha had changed my life. My friends and family had said I was an idiot. I was throwing away my future. Butch Taylor, my father, had never been a big part of my life until I had become a high school football star. For once I had a parent who gave a shit about me. It had been something I&#x2019;d craved since I was a kid. Making him proud and proving I was worth loving had been what drove me to work harder. My dream was within my reach. I had my father cheering me on, and I would make it to college and then&#x2014;I knew&#x2014;I&#x2019;d play pro ball. <br> <br>Until my dream changed the day a pair of the prettiest blue eyes I&#x2019;d ever seen stared at me across the parking lot one morning before school started. That was the first day of my sophomore year, and it would be another twelve months before I would be able to get Trisha Corbin to even speak to me. <br> <br>With one look, that girl had changed my dreams.</p><h2>5 Days to a Clutter-Free House: Quick, Easy Ways to Clear Up Your Space</h2><p>While most of us aren't hoarders we can all benefit from assessing and reducing the clutter in our homes--and then organizing what's left.

Tlass pushed for conciliation but Assad decided to crush the uprising -- an act which would catapult the country into an eight-year long war, killing almost half a million and fueling terrorism and a global refugee crisis.<br><br><i>Assad or We Burn the Country</i> examines Syria's tragedy through the generational saga of the Assad and Tlass families, once deeply intertwined and now estranged in Bashar's bloody quest to preserve his father's inheritance. By drawing on his own reporting experience in Damascus and exclusive interviews with Tlass, Dagher takes readers within palace walls to reveal the family behind the destruction of a country and the chaos of an entire region.<br><br>Dagher shows how one of the world's most vicious police states came to be and explains how a regional conflict extended globally, engulfing the Middle East and pitting the United States and Russia against one another. <br><br>Timely, propulsive, and expertly reported, <i>Assad or We Burn the Country</i> is the definitive account of this global crisis, going far beyond the news story that has dominated headlines for years.</p><p>Sam Dagher has reported in the Middle East for more than fifteen years, most recently for <i>The Atlantic</i>. He was the only non-Syrian reporter for a major Western media outlet based in Damascus from 2012 to 2014, a period during which he was arrested by a pro Assad militia and briefly held in an underground <i>mukhabarat </i>(secret police) prison. He was later expelled from Syria for reporting deemed unfavorable to the regime. He has worked for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>, and <i>Agence France Presse</i>, and has covered the conflict in Iraq, the Arab Spring uprisings, and Libya. The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> nominated Dagher's work from Syria for the Pulitzer Prize and other journalism awards."A vivid and powerful account of the roots and course of the conflict, setting it in the context of Assad's personal history and approach to power."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Washington Post</i></i></b><br><br><strong>A <em>New York Times Book Review</em> Editor's Choice Pick</strong><br><br>"Dagher draws on history, interviews and his own experience as a reporter in Syria to depict an utterly ruthless regime."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Editor's Choice</i></b><br><br>"[An] impressively detailed account"&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Guardian US</i></i></b><br><br>"Sam Dagher's book <i>Assad or We Burn the Country </i>is a vivid and at times gruelling account of the suppression of the Syrian resistance...It is a powerful testimony of a war correspondent for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. His account carries the outrage and passion of a witness to atrocity."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Financial Times </i></i></b><br><br>"He was briefly held by pro-regime militiamen in an underground prison and was summarily expelled by the Mukhabarat in 2014. This gives his description of events a credibility lacking in many other accounts."&#x2015;<b><i>Patrick Cockburn, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></i></b><br><br>"An important addition to the existing literature on the Middle East - especially Syria - by an astute Middle East watcher...It is absolutely indispensable to understand current Middle Eastern and Syrian situation."&#x2015;<b><i><em>The Washington Book Review</em></i></b><br><br>"As with so much of Dagher's writing, what's striking about the book is it doesn't just confirm the worst that's been reported about Assad's regime in the much-maligned "mainstream media;" it unearths new ways in which the horror and criminality are in fact more terrible than previously understood."&#x2015;<b><i>Alex Rowell, <em>Al-Jumhuriya</em></i></b><br><br>"Drawing on years of reporting and interviews with those at the top of the Syrian regime, Sam Dagher's book is one that readers won't be able to put down."&#x2015;<b><i>Kerry Breen, <em>TODAY Show </em></i></b><br><br>"As the only Western reporter based in Damascus during the early years of the civil war, Dagher has a rich perspective on the inner machinations of the regime of Bashar al Assad. In this important book, he lays out in grim detail the staggering cynicism and ruthless brutality of the Assad family. In doing so, he provides readers with a timely description of the dynasty that precipitated the destruction of a nation."&#x2015;<b><i>Clarissa Ward, Chief International Correspondent, <i>CNN International</i></i></b></p><h2>Little Siberia</h2><p><p>A man is racing along the remote snowy roads of Hurmevaara in Finland, when there is flash in the sky and something crashes into the car. That something turns about to be a highly valuable meteorite. With euro signs lighting up the eyes of the locals, the treasure is temporarily placed in a neighborhood museum, under the watchful eye of a priest named Joel. But Joel has a lot more on his mind than simply protecting the riches that have apparently rained down from heaven. His wife has just revealed that she is pregnant. Unfortunately Joel has strong reason to think the baby isn&#x2019;t his.

Spivak's essay hones in on the historical and ideological factors that obstruct the possibility of being heard for those who inhabit the periphery. It is a probing interrogation of what it means to have political subjectivity, to be able to access the state, and to suffer the burden of difference in a capitalist system that promises equality yet withholds it at every turn.<br><br>Since its publication, "Can the Subaltern Speak?" has been cited, invoked, imitated, and critiqued. In these phenomenal essays, eight scholars take stock of the effects and response to Spivak's work. They begin by contextualizing the piece within the development of subaltern and postcolonial studies and the quest for human rights. Then, through the lens of Spivak's essay, they rethink historical problems of subalternity, voicing, and death. A final section situates "Can the Subaltern Speak?" within contemporary issues, particularly new international divisions of labor and the politics of silence among indigenous women of Guatemala and Mexico. In an afterword, Spivak herself considers her essay's past interpretations and future incarnations and the questions and histories that remain secreted in the original and revised versions of "Can the Subaltern Speak?"&#x2014;both of which are reprinted in this book.</p><p><p>A study of the essay that forever changed postcolonial theory.</p>Rosalind C.

But at times I&#x2019;ve had to coach myself through my own makeover&#x2014;forging into new territory, allowing my authentic self to emerge, and embracing<br>frightening uncertainty with hope and faith. I understand what it feels like to have your world turned upside down and your dreams crushed, to be headed down a path toward the future you&#x2019;ve long planned&#x2014;and find yourself knocked completely off that path. This isn&#x2019;t the way I planned it, I thought to myself as I reached for my third box of tissues, my eyes red, nose stuffy, and face puffy. I stood bent over the kitchen counter, sobbing in desperation. So used to feeling in control of my life, I was suddenly and completely not in control.<br><br>This can&#x2019;t be happening to me, I thought. This can&#x2019;t be the end. But in my spirit, I knew it was. As that reality sunk in, my sobs turned into wails&#x2014;uncontrollable and loud. If you&#x2019;d been in the room, you would have recognized the unmistakable sound of grief that accompanies death. In this case I was mourning the death of my marriage. Reality overwhelmed me in wave after wave of sadness and uncertainty. I felt betrayed and fearful.<br><br>I knew what I had to do. But when you find yourself lying on a bed of thorns, remaining as still as possible seems less painful than attempting to extricate yourself.<br><br>As I sunk into utter misery, I was suddenly consumed by the fear that I might be having some sort of breakdown. I needed someone to hear me, to validate my despair. I picked up the phone and called my mother. She knew what I was going through, but she had never heard me like this. I couldn&#x2019;t get any words out, just sobs and gasps for air.<br><br>&#x201c;Valorie?&#x201d; she said anxiously. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong? What happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stop crying,&#x201d; I finally muttered. &#x201c;I feel like I&#x2019;m going crazy. I feel like I&#x2019;m losing my mind.&#x201d;<br><br>If I expected commiseration and comfort, I was in for a surprise.<br><br>However, I should have known that my mother&#x2014;a woman who has recovered from serious physical, financial, and family setbacks&#x2014;wouldn&#x2019;t let me wallow in my misery. Looking back now, the situation reminds me of a scene in one of those old black-and-white movies where a panicked woman (that would be me) starts sputtering nonsense, her words coming faster and faster until finally someone (that would be my mom) slaps her across the face to bring her back to reality.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going crazy!&#x201d; she declared. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re human and you&#x2019;re in pain. Life and death are in the power of the tongue. The enemy wants you to say you&#x2019;re losing your mind. You&#x2019;re not. Now go into the bathroom,&#x201d; she said firmly. &#x201c;Wash your face, and then go take a walk. It&#x2019;s a pretty day outside. Call me when you come back.&#x201d;<br><br>My mother&#x2019;s jarring words rang with truth. After some deep breaths, I felt just a glimmer of hope&#x2014;a sudden uplifting of my soul. Sometimes, a glimmer of hope is all you need to take that next step forward. That step, for me, was a simple declaration: &#x201c;This will not destroy me. I believe God, and in the Word He says He is with me wherever I go. So I will walk through this fire, but it will not consume me. It will not. On the other side of this, I will be a better and stronger woman.&#x201d;<br><br>Your Recovery Begins Today<br><br>That day my mother reminded me of an important lesson&#x2014;our first guiding principle for facing a setback: &#x201c;I will not feel sorry for myself.&#x201d; I had been knocked out, but her words were my wake-up call. Of course, it wasn&#x2019;t the last time I cried, but I never again cried from that woe-is-me place. In that pivotal moment, I chose faith over fear.<br><br>Today I want to help you make the same choice and embark on your own road to a better tomorrow.<br><br>It may be hard to believe now, but I&#x2019;m convinced that on the other side of your difficult circumstances, something good is waiting, something better than you&#x2019;ve previously thought or imagined. But to find it, you&#x2019;ll have to surrender your will and allow God&#x2019;s strength and grace to guide you.<br><br>Hebrews 11:1 says, &#x201c;Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen&#x201d; (nkjv). This truth gives you something to fiercely cling to when a setback pushes a dream so far out of reach that you start to lose hope. To the outside world, your hope may seem delusional. But that&#x2019;s when faith is most critical. That&#x2019;s when you are called to believe in the things &#x201c;not seen.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s when you must choose to trust God to give you the desires of your heart, in His timing&#x2014;or to turn your desires toward something ultimately better.<br><br>God may restore everything you have lost&#x2014;or He may open your eyes to a new life, one filled with greater purpose and fulfillment than you can imagine at this moment. Our definition of success often differs greatly from His. If you&#x2019;re willing to let God realign your life to match His definition of success, you&#x2019;ll be able to view your setback not as a disappointment or failure but as a positive part of His plan to mold you and shape you according to His perfect design.<br><br>Tempered by Trials<br><br>Successfully recovering from a setback is not just about restoring the externals you may have lost&#x2014;such as the job, the money, the physical ability, or the relationship&#x2014;or just regaining your footing on the path to your goals. It also involves strengthening your inner resilience.<br><br>The essence of resilience is your ability to effectively navigate adversity and courageously face whatever life throws your way. Though you may be bruised and battered by challenges, your spirit still soars. In fact, you choose to believe that you can become a better, richer person because of your experience.<br><br>You may be familiar with tempered steel or tempered glass&#x2014;elements made stronger by repeated exposure to heat and cold. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary cites one definition of temper as &#x201c;to make stronger and more resilient through hardship.&#x201d;1 This is the opportunity your current setback offers: to have your character strengthened by the heat of battle so you emerge not only victorious but also forever changed for the better.<br><br>You may feel as if you&#x2019;re just hanging on right now, trying to survive. But I want you to do more than survive. My goal is to help you eventually thrive. So this book has two parallel goals: first, to help you rebuild the aspects of your external world that have crumbled, and second, to help you gain the tools you need to not only navigate current setbacks but also to deal effectively with future surprises&#x2014;because we know that change is the one constant in life on a broken planet.<br><br>Despite our best plans, earnest preparation, and good intentions, the truth is we don&#x2019;t have as much control of our lives as we like to think we do. You will inevitably face other challenges in the future, so why not embrace the opportunity now to gain skills that will help you recover more quickly next time? If you can grow through this difficult<br>season, expanding your character, faith, and wisdom, then the journey you are on right now may just be one of the most important turning points of your life.<br><br>The Journey Matters as Much as the Destination<br><br>A central theme in this book is embracing the process, not just the destination. Please don&#x2019;t rush through each chapter in an effort to get answers. Instead, let the words speak to you, prompting insight and reflection, transformation and hope.<br><br>We&#x2019;ll begin the journey together, right where you are&#x2014;in the ditch of uncertainty, reeling from whatever unexpected shift has taken place in your life. Then step by step, as the pages turn, I&#x2019;ll help you get your bearings, determine your next steps, and begin walking a path toward a positive future.<br><br>The principles outlined in this book are rooted in solid biblical principles and proven research in the field of positive psychology. While traditional psychology, especially since World War II, has focused primarily on fixing what&#x2019;s wrong with people (a crucially important endeavor), positive psychology focuses on what goes right with people. What is it<br>that makes us happier? more resilient? more fulfilled? Recent discoveries in this area offer some compelling and extremely practical advice for how to navigate major life challenges and come out on the other side a happier and wiser person.<br><br>In my own graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania, I was excited to discover that so much scientific research aligns with the ancient wisdom of the Bible. I used these strategies to navigate the unexpected turns in my own life; and in each chapter, I will give you practical steps to craft your personal comeback out of unwelcome&nbsp; circumstances, whether your challenge is in the area of finances, work, relationships, health&#x2014;or has impacted multiple aspects of your life.<br><br>Each chapter includes further guidance in the form of coaching exercises to increase your confidence, help you draw on your strengths, and deliberately propel you toward progress. Please don&#x2019;t skip these exercises! Only through deliberate, thoughtful action will you generate real change in your perspective and your circumstances.<br><br>In addition, all along the way you&#x2019;ll be inspired by real-life stories of resilience. You&#x2019;ll hear from people who have been paralyzed, lost their jobs, been forced into bankruptcy, endured painful divorces, lost their homes and hundreds of thousands of dollars, endured the death of a spouse or child or both&#x2014;and yet somehow not only survived but eventually thrived. They were able to move forward&#x2014;and to discover the fulfilling life God had planned for them.<br><br>As I spoke with these individuals who have endured so much with tenacity and faith, I gained perspective on my own setback. In fact, I began to view my own experience less as a setback and more as an opportunity to learn and grow. I realized that my life experience had taken me to emotional and spiritual depths I would never have reached other-<br>wise. Would I have chosen to go through it? No. Am I a better person because I persevered and bounced back? Absolutely.<br><br>My sincere hope is that, one day, you&#x2019;ll be able look back and say the same of your own experience. I&#x2019;m planting the seed of hope because I know this to be true: &#x201c;All things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose&#x201d; (Romans 8:28, nkjv).<br><br>Don&#x2019;t try to figure out how it&#x2019;s going to &#x201c;work together&#x201d; just yet. Simply believe that it will and let God guide you forward, step by step.</p><h2>Isis Orb (The Xanth Novels)</h2><p><b>A quest to fulfill a lifelong wish leads to magic, adventure&#x2014;and puns&#x2014;as the <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author revisits the enchanted land of Xanth.</b><br><br> &nbsp;In Xanth, everyone has a talent.

The Pulitzer-winning author of <i>Our Town</i> and <i>The Skin of Our Teeth</i> returned constantly to the short form, perhaps more than any other contemporary playwright. His mastery is revealed in cut gems <i>Happy Journey to Trenton and Camden,</i> <i>The Long Christmas Dinner,</i> and especially <i>Pullman Car Hiawatha.</i> With this volume edited by Donald Gallup and Wilder's nephew A. Tappan Wilder we add the playlets of two great unfinished cycles, <i>The Seven Ages of Man</i> and <i>The Seven Deadly Sins,</i> several of which have been completed by a scholar, respectfully based on Wilder's writings and conversations. Best among the hitherto unproduced works is <i>Rivers Under the Earth,</i> about the dark currents moving beneath the placid surface of a family on summer vacation. Like so many of Wilder's longer works, these short plays seem to be homely slices of Americana--but every once in a while they suddenly yield glimpses of the infinite.Thornton Wilder was one of the most distinguished and versatile American writers of the 20th century. Among many honors, he was awarded three Pulitzer Prizes: two for drama, one for fiction. His stage works include Our Town, The Skin of Our Teeth and The Matchmaker--remaining among the best-loved and most-produced plays of all time.</p><h2>Hand Mending Made Easy: Save Time and Money Repairing Your Own Clothes</h2><p>Twelve easy, well-illustrated lessons&nbsp;demonstrate how to mend clothes in the comfort of one&#x2019;s home.

He is also the author of the acclaimed thriller <b>Cold Springs</b> and the young adult novel <i>The Lightning Thief</i>. Rick Riordan lives with his family in San Antonio, Texas.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br>We got married in a thunderstorm. That should&#x2019;ve been my first warning. <br><br>The Southwest Craft Center courtyard was festooned with white crepe paper. The tables were laden with fresh tamales, chips and salsa. Cases of Shiner Bock sweated on ice in tin buckets. The margarita machine was humming. The San Antonio River flowed past the old limestone walls. <br><br>Maia looked beautiful in her cream bridal dress. Her black hair was curled in ringlets and her coppery skin glowed with health. <br><br>The guests had arrived: my mother, fresh from a tour of Guatemala; my brother, Garrett, not-so-fresh from our long bachelor party in Austin; and a hundred other relatives, cops, thugs, ex-cons, lawyers&#x2014;all the people who had made my life so interesting the past few decades. <br><br>Then the clouds came. Lightning sparked off a mesquite tree. The sky opened up, and our outdoor wedding became a footrace to the chapel with the retired Baptist minister and the Buddhist monk leading the pack. <br><br>Larry Cho, the monk, had a commanding early lead, but Reverend Buckner Fanning held steady around the tamale table while Larry the Buddhist had to swerve to avoid a beer keg and got blocked out by a couple of bail bondsmen. Buckner was long retired, but he sure stayed fit. He won the race to the chapel and held the door for the others as we came pouring in. <br><br>I was last, helping Maia, since she couldn&#x2019;t move very quickly. Partly that was because of the wedding dress. Mostly it was because she was eight and a half months pregnant. I held a plastic bag over our heads as we plodded through the rain. <br><br>&#x201c;This was not in the forecast,&#x201d; she protested. <br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I agreed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking God owes us a refund.&#x201d; <br><br>Inside, the chapel was dark and smelled of musty limestone. The cedar floorboards creaked under our feet. The crowd milled around, watching out the windows as our party decorations were barraged into mush. Rain drummed off the grass so hard it made a layer of haze three feet high. The crepe paper melted and watery salsa overflowed off the edge of the tables. <br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Buckner said, beaming as if God had made this glorious moment just for us. &#x201c;We still have a holy matrimony to perform.&#x201d; <br><br>Actually, I was raised Catholic, which is why the wedding was half-Buddhist, half-Baptist. Maia had not been a practicing Buddhist since she was a little girl in China, but she liked Larry the Buddhist, and the incense and beads made her feel nostalgic. <br><br>Buckner Fanning was the most respected Baptist minister in San Antonio. He also knew my mom from way back. When the Catholic priest had been reluctant to perform the ceremony (something about Maia being pregnant out of wedlock; go figure), my mom had recruited Buckner. <br><br>For his part, Buckner had talked to me in advance about doing the right thing by getting married, how he hoped we would raise our child to know God. I told him we hadn&#x2019;t actually talked to God about the matter yet, but we were playing phone tag. Buckner, fortunately, had a sense of humor. He agreed to marry us. <br><br>We were a pretty bedraggled crew when we reassembled in the old chapel. Rain poured down the stained-glass windows and hammered on the roof. I glanced over at Ana DeLeon, our homicide detective friend, who was toweling off her daughter Lucia&#x2019;s hair. Ana smiled at me. I gave her a wink, but it was painful to hold her eyes too long. It was hard not to think about her husband, who should have been standing at her side. <br><br>Larry the Buddhist rang his gong and lit some incense. He chanted a sutra. Then Buckner began talking about the marriage covenant. <br><br>My eyes met Maia&#x2019;s. She was studying me quizzically. Maybe she was wondering why she&#x2019;d agreed to hook up with a guy like me. Then she smiled, and I remembered how we&#x2019;d met in a bar in Berkeley fifteen years ago. Every time she smiled like that, she sent an electric charge straight down my back. <br><br>I&#x2019;m afraid I missed most of what Buckner had to say. But I heard the &#x201c;I do&#x201d; part. I said the vow without hesitation. <br><br>Afterward, we waded through the well-wishers: my old&nbsp; girlfriend, Lillian Cambridge; Madeleine White, the mafia princess; Larry Drapiewski, the retired deputy; Milo Chavez, the music agent from Nashville; Messieurs Terrence and Goldman, Maia&#x2019;s old bosses from the law firm in San Francisco; my mom and her newest boyfriend, a millionaire named Jack Mariner. All sorts of dangerous rain-soaked people. <br><br>We ate soggy wedding cake and drank champagne and waited for the storm to pass. As Maia talked with some of her former colleagues, Garrett cornered me at the bar. <br><br>My brother was wearing what passed for wedding garb: a worn tuxedo jacket over his tie-dyed T-shirt. His scraggly beard and poorly combed hair looked like a wheat field after a hailstorm. His tuxedo pants were pinned up (since he didn&#x2019;t have legs) and he&#x2019;d woven carnations through the spokes of his wheelchair. <br><br>&#x201c;Grats, little bro.&#x201d; He lifted his plate of tamales in salute. &#x201c;Good eats.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You congratulating me on the tamales or the marriage?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Depends.&#x201d; He belched into his fist, which was for him pretty darned discreet. &#x201c;What you got planned for the honeymoon?&#x201d; <br><br>Right then, my internal alarms should&#x2019;ve been ringing. I should&#x2019;ve backed away, told him to get another plate of tamales and saved myself a lot of trouble. Instead, I said, <br><br>&#x201c;Nothing, really. Maia&#x2019;s pregnant, you may have noticed.&#x201d; Garrett waved his hand dismissively. <br><br>&#x201c;Doing nothing for your honeymoon don&#x2019;t cut it, little bro. Listen, I got a proposition.&#x201d; <br><br>Maybe it was the joyous occasion, or the fact that I was&nbsp; surrounded by friends. Maybe it was just the fact that it was raining too hard to leave. But I was in the mood to think well of my brother. <br><br>I would have plenty of time to regret that later. But that afternoon, with the rain coming down, I listened as Garrett told me his idea.&nbsp;</p><h2>Mystical Astrology According to Ibn &#39;Arabi (1) (The Fons Vitae Titus Burckhardt series)</h2><p>A unique work, providing the underlying spiritual principles lacking in most modern books of astrology.

The transition from high school to college is one of the most pivotal times in a young person&#39;s life. After departing from under the protective wings of their parents, young adults often have trouble holding firm to the Christian faith. Stand Your Ground is an introduction to apologetics for young adults in high school or college. The book includes thirteen chapters that confront the overwhelming intellectual attacks Christian college students face on university campuses. Dean Hardy takes readers on a spiritual and intellectual journey, addressing such issues as the nature of truth and reality, the investigation of other worldviews, the evidence for Christianity, critics&#39; arguments against Christianity, and the relationship between apologetics and evangelism.</p><p>Dean Hardy is the Bible Department Chair at Charlotte Christian School in Charlotte, North Carolina."'Stand Your Ground' covers a lot of ground in an easy-to-understand manner.

Though this is not an alphabet book in the traditional sense, it is an A to Z look at twenty-five poems and one African American spiritual selected by Ashley Bryan from a wide range of African American poets. <br>His selections are, for the most part, not complete poems, but fragments -- samples that are complete in their own way, and that inspired him to create pictures that capture the essence of the poetry in another form. his marvelous paintings, in tempera and gouache, are his salute to the twenty-five poets whose works are included. <br>Well known for his story-telling, his picture books, his own poetry, and for his lectures on African American poetry, Ashley Bryan here gives readers of all ages a chance to share the joy he has experienced in the work of some of the poets he especially enjoys.</p><p><i>Ashley Bryan's ABC of African American Poetry</i> is not an alphabet book. Award-winning children's book author and former teacher Ashley Bryan has simply hit upon a straightforward way to present the work of his favorite African American poets: he uses a letter of each poem to organize the 25 excerpts and one African American spiritual. His vibrant artwork, with bold strokes of paint reminiscent of Vincent van Gogh, successfully captures the essence of each piece. "As I read," Bryan writes, "images sprang from the lines of the poets... Finally, I chose the sketches that offered a balanced play of images and did finished paintings from them in tempera paints and gouache colors." <p> Poems ranging from the intense to the whimsical reflect the diverse voices of poets such as Rita Dove, Lucille Clifton, and Gwendolyn Brooks. A colorful elephant stands solidly next to Countee Cullen's poem: "Dear Noah: Please save me a spot / Exposed to the sun, where the Mice are <i>not</i>; / But if I <i>must</i> share my chamber, the Ant / Is the one I should welcome. Yours: L. E. Phant." From Langston Hughes we hear, "There are words like Freedom / Sweet and wonderful to say. / On my heart-strings freedom sings / All day everyday." And Eloise Greenfield chimes in with "Harriet Tubman didn't take no stuff / Wasn't scared of nothing neither / Didn't come in this world to be no slave / And wasn't going to stay one neither." This innovative, easy-to-absorb, boldly illustrated introduction to a rich variety of African American poets would be a valuable addition to any child's bookshelf. <i>(All ages)</i></p>Thus begins Coretta Scott King Award-winner Ashley Bryan&#39;s collection of inspiring excerpts of poems by celebrated African American poets. Beautifully illustrated with his own tempera and gouache paintings, Ashley Bryan&#39;s unique alphabet book will delight readers of any age.</p><h2>Training the Gaited Horse: From the Trail to the Rail</h2><p>This book takes into consideration training the gaited horse for the trail or the rail for a show horse.The book is a detailed look at the gaits of the Tennessee Walking Horse, Missouri Fox Trotter, and the Rocky Mountain Horse.

Walking the streets of New York with Norton tucked into his pocket, Gethers began forming an intense attachment to his new pet. Before long Norton was flying with his owner on the Concorde to Europe, sipping milk in Parisian caf�s, and eating custom-made pounce pizzas at Spago. Soon Gethers began to detail Norton&#x2019;s adventures in print, and with <i>The Cat Who Went to Paris</i> and <i>A Cat Abroad</i> the duo made history as well as many, many friends around the world. <br><br><i>The Cat Who&#x2019;ll Live Forever</i> chronicles the latest in Norton&#x2019;s astonishing adventures, celebrity encounters, and worldwide excursions, culminating in his heartwarming�and heartbreaking�final cross-country trip.

But as Norton gets older his schedule slows down and he struggles with the aches and pains and physical inconveniences that go along with age, teaching his human the essentials of loving and caring and coping with illness. Ultimately Norton passes along to his owner the most valuable lessons of all�how to deal with death and grief, how to live life on your own terms, and how to appreciate and savor the joyful times that come along while we&#x2019;re here on earth.<br><br><i>The Cat Who&#x2019;ll Live Forever</i> is, on one level, a touching meditation on love and relationships and dealing with the pain of inevitable loss.

Each of us has a distinctive lovemap, as different and individual as a fingerprint.In this book, Dr. Money outlines healthy lovemap development as well as lovemap pathology - lovemaps gone awry. Such pathology falls into three categories: hypophilia (sexual dysfunction, such as impotence), hyperphilia (erotomania), and paraphilia (perversions). Paraphilia, another term coined by Money (from the Latin para - away from what is expected, and philia - love) can range from &#34;those that are playful and harmless to those that are bizarre and deadly.&#34;Presenting case histories, Lovemaps describes the sexual practices of several patients and subsequent treatments of their paraphilias. Money pioneered the application of the hormone MPA, or Depo-Provera, to treat repeat sex criminals. He believes he has proved that science can prevent paraphilic sex offending, as is the case for other, physiological diseases.Lovemaps and its stirring accounts of lovemap pathology in case histories, (which are indexed under &#34;paraphilia&#34;), can be invaluable tools for those in the fields of sexology, child psychology, clinical psychology, criminology and, with its comprehensive glossary, the general reader - in short, anyone interested in human sexual development.</p><p><b>John Money, Ph.D.</b>&nbsp;(1921 - 2006), was professor emeritus of medical psychology and pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University, and the author of many books including&nbsp;<i>Sin, Science and the Sex Police</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Lovemaps</i>. A renowned sexologist who specialized in sexual identity studies and the biology of gender, Money coined the terms "gender identity" and "gender role."</p><h2>Problem of Pain</h2><p>problem of pain, the by c.s. lewis (usa)</p><p><i>The Problem of Pain</i> answers the universal question, "Why would an all-loving, all-knowing God allow people to experience pain and suffering?" Master Christian apologist C.S. Lewis asserts that pain is a problem because our finite, human minds selfishly believe that pain-free lives would prove that God loves us. In truth, by asking for this, we want God to love us less, not more than he does. "Love, in its own nature, demands the perfecting of the beloved; that the mere 'kindness' which tolerates anything except suffering in its object is, in that respect at the opposite pole from Love." In addressing "Divine Omnipotence," "Human Wickedness," "Human Pain," and "Heaven," Lewis succeeds in lifting the reader from his frame of reference by artfully capitulating these topics into a conversational tone, which makes his assertions easy to swallow and even easier to digest. Lewis is straightforward in aim as well as honest about his impediments, saying, "I am not arguing that pain is not painful. Pain hurts. I am only trying to show that the old Christian doctrine that being made perfect through suffering is not incredible. To prove it palatable is beyond my design." The mind is expanded, God is magnified, and the reader is reminded that he is not the center of the universe as Lewis carefully rolls through the dissertation that suffering is God's will in preparing the believer for heaven and for the full weight of glory that awaits him there. While many of us naively wish that God had designed a "less glorious and less arduous destiny" for his children, the fortune lies in Lewis's inclination to set us straight with his charming wit and pious mind. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>Why must humanity suffer? In this elegant and thoughtful work, C.S. Lewis questions the pain and suffering that occur everyday and how this contrasts with the notion of a God that is both omnipotent and good -- the answer to this critical theological problem is within these pages.</p><h2>Marathon Man: My 26.2-Mile Journey from Unknown Grad Student to the Top of the Running World</h2><p><p><b>The legendary long-distance runner details his historic victory in the 1975 Boston Marathon that launched the modern running boom</b></p><p>Within a span of two hours and nine minutes, Bill Rodgers went from obscurity to legend, from Bill Rodgers to "Boston Billy." In doing so, he instantly became the people's champ and the poster boy for the soulful 1970s distance runner. Having won the Boston Marathon and New York Marathon four times each, he remains the only marathoner to have appeared on the cover of <i>Sports Illustrated</i> twice. Winning the Holy Grail of marathons in an unthinkable record time changed Bill's life forever.</p><p>But his dramatic breakthrough in Boston also changed the lives of countless others, instilling in other American runners the belief that they could follow in his footsteps, and inspiring thousands of regular people to lace up their shoes and chase down their own dreams.

There was nothing more fickle than Mother Nature around April in New England. Would I have to run the Boston Marathon in a snow squall like those poor racers in 1961? Would I have to brave a torrential downpour like the one that greeted competitors in 1970? Or would I have to endure the sweltering heat that brutalized runners in 1909&#x2014;a race that earned the nickname &#x201c;the Inferno&#x201d; after the mercury soared to 97 degrees? <br>&#x201c;Bill,&#x201d; said my big brother, Charlie, standing beside me on the town green. <br>&#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; I said, not really hearing him. Feel that brisk wind, I thought to myself. The heat will not bring me to my knees today, not like it has before. My prayers had been answered&#x2014;a cool, overcast spring morning. The perfect day to run a marathon. <br>It was here of all places, in the sleepy New England village of Hopkinton, Massachusetts, that I gathered with some two thousand topflight (I can&#x2019;t stand the term &#x201c;elite&#x201d;) runners for the start of the Boston Marathon. On the town green, I loosened up and prepared for the race, amid spectators milling about and other competitors warming up. <br>The marathon has turned the center of this quaint small town into a bustling scene of excitement. You could feel the electricity in the air. Swarms of people passed by me on the green. Locals carried lawn chairs to set up along the course. Runners paced in nervous anticipation. A man in a clown suit sold colorful balloons. I heard the Hopkinton High School marching band playing nearby. For a big kid like me, it was heaven. For a racer with undiagnosed attention deficit disorder, also me, it was dangerously distracting. But not today. Not today. <br>&#x201c;Bill!&#x201d; My brother&#x2019;s loud Boston accent snapped me out of my gaze. &#x201c;Well? Do you want some gloves?&#x201d; he inquired. <br>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s a good idea,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Did I bring any?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; Charlie said in a teasing sarcasm. <br>I blinked at him a couple of times. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ll run down to that little hardware store,&#x201d; he said, pointing to the row of stores farther down the center of town. <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said. <br>Charlie cut off down the street, straight at the statue of the World War I doughboy soldier, rifle on shoulder in midmarch. He stopped dead in his tracks as if the doughboy, suddenly springing to life, had aimed a rifle at his forehead. Charlie swung around to me and shouted, &#x201c;Stay there!&#x201d; <br>I admit it. I&#x2019;ve been known to get lost easily. And forget stuff. And lose track of time. But come on, Charlie. My mind was focused like a laser beam on one thing today. For countless months, I had trained like a man possessed, running over a 150 miles a week, spending solitary hours circling the dirt path around Jamaica Pond. I&#x2019;d punished my body on the very hills I would soon face, pushing everything else in my life to the periphery. For so long, I&#x2019;d thought about nothing but winning this race. And standing there, moments before the gun sounded, I felt ready for a battle. <br>Speaking of battles, the race has been held every Patriots&#x2019; Day in April since 1897, in part to commemorate the anniversary of the most famous run of all, Paul Revere&#x2019;s midnight ride on April 18, 1775, to warn the patriots in Lexington and Concord that the British were coming. Fifteen runners participated in that first race in 1897; ten finished. John J. McDermott of New York emerged victorious, crossing the finish line in a new world record time of 2:55:10. <br>Boston oozes prestige and tradition. It&#x2019;s the oldest continuously run marathon in the world, held on almost the exact same course for over a century&#x2014;a course that was patterned after the ancient route from Marathon to Athens. It&#x2019;s also famous for being the only marathon in the world in which all runners have to qualify. Many families over many generations have returned annually to run the race, or to watch the drama unfold from their go-to spot along the road, creating a festive row of lawn chairs and barbecue grills. Stroll around Boston on Marathon Monday and you&#x2019;ll know why they call it the world&#x2019;s biggest block party, or what&#x2019;s known around these parts as &#x201c;a seriously wicked ragefest.&#x201d; <br>Truth be told, I didn&#x2019;t always grasp the romantic, almost mythical, attraction that runners have felt toward the race, going back to the early 1900s. In those days, hundreds of immigrant workers came from far and wide to the city for a shot to prove themselves worthy of the greatest honor a runner could achieve&#x2014;the laurel wreath crown of the Boston Marathon. Some of these dusty-faced dreamers would hop freight trains to Boston with nothing but a pair of sneakers in their knapsack and a few cents in their pocket. What made the marathon different from many of life&#x2019;s other competitions is that sometimes this was all a man needed to come out on top. <br>Take Frank Zuna, a wiry, 150-pound plumber from Newark, New Jersey. In 1921, the twenty-seven-year-old man of Czech Bohemian descent jumped the train to Boston, wearing his racing gear under his dirty work clothes. Zuna conquered the field in a record-shattering time of 2:18:57, then almost skipped the public celebration in his honor. He told the BAA officials he had to grab the next train home or else he would be late for his plumbing job the next morning. <br>To this day, runners from all over the world, from remote parts of the Ukraine to the mud-hutted villages of Kenya, grow up dreaming of running just one race&#x2014;the Boston Marathon. Given all the lore, the tradition, the epic stories of athletic triumph and tragedy, the one-of-a-kind personality of the course, the city where it takes place, and the people who make up the huge crowds along the way, it&#x2019;s no wonder many consider this the Holy Grail of marathon running in America and the world over. <br>There I was, a pale, drifty grad student, warming up on the town green, same as Frank Zuna and all the other dirt-poor, skinny-legged dreamers who had come before me. I hopped up and down a little in my lucky, faded gray Camp Wonderland warm-up sweatshirt, blowing on my cold hands. Just then I felt a hard slap on my shoulder. It was my friend Tom Fleming. He was wearing a smart-aleck grin, along with a white mesh T-shirt that exposed his nipples, and could easily have come from the closet of wrestler Randy &#x201c;Macho Man&#x201d; Savage. <br>This was Tom&#x2014;a Jersey dude, amped to ten on the dial, ready to go toe-to-toe with anybody, anytime. If I glided swiftly over the road like a gazelle, Tom charged down it like a bull. Hanging on his bedroom wall was this sign: SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD THERE IS SOMEONE TRAINING WHEN YOU ARE NOT. WHEN YOU RACE HIM, HE WILL WIN. Tom wasn&#x2019;t about to let that happen; he put in more hard miles than anybody I knew. But under all that hot-blooded, chest-puffing drive, Tom was a nice guy with a big heart. <br>&#x201c;Hey, Bill,&#x201d; said Tom. &#x201c;How do you plan to see where you&#x2019;re going with all that hair in your face?&#x201d; Before I could respond, Tom threw a white sweatband over my head, causing my hair to cover my face and blind me. <br>With my long hair, skinny frame, ratty sweatshirt, and discount tube socks, I certainly didn&#x2019;t look the part of the typical track athlete. Then again, none of the guys in our little crew&#x2014;the Greater Boston Track Club&#x2014;fit the picture of dedicated, word-class competitors. Alberto Salazar, an eighteen-year-old kid from Wayland, Massachusetts, used to tag along with us on our workouts (hence his nickname, &#x201c;the Rookie&#x201d;). He described us as &#x201c;oddball hippie outcasts&#x201d; and me in particular as a &#x201c;sweet, friendly ragamuffin guy; a hippie with a dirty-blond ponytail.&#x201d; <br>We might have been a bunch of rogue runners with our long hair and free-spirited lifestyle, but good luck finding a more hardcore group of athletes in 1975. We ran more miles in a week than most people drive in their cars. Day in and day out, we trained to the point of exhaustion, through bone-chilling New England winters and sticky-hot Boston summers. <br>None of us made any money road racing because there wasn&#x2019;t any to be made&#x2014;if you won a race, you were thrilled to come home with a new blender. It was an amateur, <i>Chariots of Fire</i>&#x2013;style situation: We ran for the love of the sport and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of what could be done in that day and age. Roger Bannister, the Oxford medical student who became the first man to break the four-minute mile in 1954, a feat previously thought to be humanly impossible, called it &#x201c;a challenge of the human spirit.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s exactly how we saw it. (Coincidentally, 1975 was the year Bannister would suffer a near-fatal car accident that forced him to give up running.) <br>I parted my hair out of the way so I could see again. Tom was staring back at me with a cocky grin <br>&#x201c;Looking good,&#x201d; Tom said. He held for a couple more seconds, then took off toward the high school, which had been turned into a makeshift staging area for the top runners. As I watched him disappear into the crowd, Charlie returned with a pair of white gardening gloves. <br>&#x201c;Try these on for size,&#x201d; he said. <br>I slid on the gloves. Almost instantly, my hands started to warm up. I was lucky to have Charlie there to support me. It was nice to have the company. Kept the nerves calmer. <br>As for my girlfriend, Ellen, she&#x2019;d camped out somewhere along the second half of the route. She had the idea to write BOSTON&#x2014;GBTC in black marker on the front of my singlet the night before in our apartment. She felt, even though the crowds lining the course had no clue who I was, they&#x2019;d be moved to cheer for me once they saw I was a local kid. I thought it was worth a shot. Besides, I took pride in representing my team and my city in the world&#x2019;s most famous footrace. <br>I had found my mesh singlet a month earlier in a Dumpster outside our housing complex in Jamaica Plain. I loved that it was so lightweight&#x2014;it felt like I was wearing nothing&#x2014;and it didn&#x2019;t chafe while I ran. What in the world a perfectly good shirt was doing in the trash, I have no idea, but I&#x2019;ve always had an eye for finding treasure among the discarded. <br>I found my shirt in a Dumpster, my water bottle was an old shampoo bottle, and my racing gloves came from the gardening aisle. As for my footwear, I assumed I would be running the marathon in my beat-up Asics with the holes and rips and broken-down arches. But a week or so before the race I received a mysterious package at my apartment with this letter attached: <br> <i>April 9, 1975</i> <br>Mr. Bill Rodgers <br>Jamaica Plain, Mass. 02130 <br>Dear Bill, <br>First of all congratulations on a fine race in Rabat. You have really improved this last year and hopefully will continue to until the Olympic games. <br>The reason I&#x2019;m writing is because Jeff Galloway told me you were interested in training in our shoes. I&#x2019;m sending you a pair of Boston &#x2019;73s and a training shoe. Any comments would be greatly appreciated. Just feel free to drop me a line and let me know what you think. <br>Wishing you continued success for &#x2019;75. <br> <i>Sincerely,</i> <br> <i>Steve Prefontaine</i> <br>I was awestruck to get a personal letter from Prefontaine, then America&#x2019;s biggest track and field sensation. While I had never met the middle-distance rock star runner from Oregon, I felt a kinship with him. Maybe because we were both skinny scrappers, each with one leg longer than the other. Like me, you could count on Prefontaine to run from the front, to push the pace, and to give it everything he had from start to finish. The whole country loved Prefontaine for the same reason I did&#x2014;he left it all out there every time he raced, heart and soul. As he once said, &#x201c;Somebody may beat me, but they are going to have to bleed to do it.&#x201d; <br>I admired that Prefontaine brought the same gutsy determination to his battles off the track that he did on them. He took on the overbearing rule enforcers of our sport at a time when few dared to do so. He knew it was wrong that the AAU dictated where and when U.S. athletes could compete. He was sick of these corrupt old men who maintained the belief that no matter how much time and passion a runner devoted to his sport, he should be barred from making a decent wage doing what he loved. According to them an American runner should make his own way, perhaps as a part-time bartender, like Prefontaine, but still compete against the best athletes from other nations like the Soviet Union and Finland who were fully funded, could train year-round, and, in some cases, were doped up on steroids. It bothered him that he had to turn down a $200,000 pro contract in 1975, then the largest ever offered to a runner, to maintain his amateur status for the 1976 Olympic Games. Instead, the world famous athlete was forced to live in a trailer with his dog, Lobo, and survive on food stamps while maintaining his tireless training program, which included grueling runs alone in the winter in Eugene, Oregon. <br>While Prefontaine was busy racking up records and winning titles at the University of Oregon, his legendary track coach Bill Bowerman created a shoe for his star runner by pressing lightweight foam rubber into his wife&#x2019;s waffle iron. The result was the first modern athletic shoe sole. In 1972, Bowerman added a &#x201c;swoosh&#x201d; logo to his sneakers, modeled after the wings of the Greek goddess Nike, and the rest is history. Meanwhile, Prefontaine became the face of Nike, as well as American distance running. <br>I had never before owned a pair of shoes that felt this light. They weighed zilch. Maybe five ounces. The waffle soles also provided better traction. They were made for running fast on the road. I loved them. The only problem: When I put the shoes on, they were slightly too big. <br>&#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;re better than anything else you&#x2019;ve got,&#x201d; Charlie said. <br>He was right, of course. I was a poor grad student. My running life offered no financial opportunities, and even if it did, I&#x2019;d have to forgo them in order to maintain my amateur status, just like Prefontaine had. I didn&#x2019;t have money for state-of-the-art racing shoes. If Prefontaine hadn&#x2019;t sent me those Boston &#x2019;73s a week before the marathon, I&#x2019;m not sure what I would have done. After all, I wasn&#x2019;t likely to find a pair of brand-new, light-as-air, waffle-soled running flats, not even if I searched every Dumpster from Jamaica Plain to Dorchester. <br>Charlie walked with me to the starting line. The scene bordered on total chaos. There were no race officials, no volunteers to help corral the eager spectators. No ropes to hold anybody back. Just a feisty, bald, seventy-one-year-old barking out orders in a thick Scottish accent. This was Jock Semple. Longtime unofficial caretaker of the Boston Marathon. He alone arranged all two thousand racers, like some crazed conductor. <br>Jock spotted me and wildly signaled for me to come over. A serious long-distance runner himself in the 1930s, he was a tough, irascible Scot who saw it as his personal mission in life to preserve the tradition of the Boston Marathon. Jock had the final say on all matters pertaining to the event. He had no patience for anybody who didn&#x2019;t have the utmost respect for the race and its runners. To Semple, the Boston Marathon was a serious athletic contest for noble and daring men&#x2014;and men only&#x2014;willing to sacrifice body and soul to achieve excellence. Jokesters like Johnny &#x201c;Cigar&#x201d; Connors, who in 1935 ran the first couple of miles while toking on two cigars at the same time, and in 1937 crossed the finish line in pink panties, causing Jock to blow his smokestack. I was fortunate that Jock took a shine to me and gave me such a low number&#x2014;#14, to denote my 1974 finish&#x2014;ensuring that I was up front with the top runners.</p><h2>Baking School: The Bread Ahead Cookbook</h2><p><p><b>Mastering bread and pastry at home, from sourdough to pizza, croissants to doughnuts.</b></p><p>Best known for Justin's world-famous doughnuts, the Bread Ahead Bakery in Borough Market is also home to their Bakery School, where thousands have learned to make sourdough, croissants, Swedish ryebread, pizza and much more besides.

Today, the Jewish population of the former Soviet Union has dwindled to half a million, but remains probably the world&#x2019;s third largest Jewish community. In the intervening century the Jews of that area have been at the center of some of the most dramatic events of modern history&#x2015;two world wars, revolutions, pogroms, political liberation, repression, and the collapse of the USSR. They have gone through tumultuous upward and downward economic and social mobility and experienced great enthusiasms and profound disappointments. In startling photographs from the archives of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research and with a lively and lucid narrative, A Century of Ambivalence traces the historical experience of Jews in Russia from a period of creativity and repression in the second half of the 19th century through the paradoxes posed by the post-Soviet era.

Their meeting changed the course of history and ultimately laid the groundwork for the complex relationship between China and the United States that we see today.<br><br> That monumental meeting in 1972&#x2013;during what Nixon called &#x201c;the week that changed the world&#x201d;&#x2013;could have been brought about only by powerful leaders: Nixon himself, a great strategist and a flawed human being, and Mao, willful and ruthless. They were assisted by two brilliant and complex statesmen, Henry Kissinger and Chou En-lai. Surrounding them were fascinating people with unusual roles to play, including the enormously disciplined and unhappy Pat Nixon and a small-time Shanghai actress turned monstrous empress, Jiang Qing. And behind all of them lay the complex history of two countries, two great and equally confident civilizations: China, ancient and contemptuous yet fearful of barbarians beyond the Middle Kingdom, and the United States, forward-looking and confident, seeing itself as the beacon for the world. <br><br> Nixon thought China could help him get out of Vietnam. Mao needed American technology and expertise to repair the damage of the Cultural Revolution. Both men wanted an ally against an aggressive Soviet Union. Did they get what they wanted? Did Mao betray his own revolutionary ideals? How did the people of China react to this apparent change in attitude toward the imperialist Americans? Did Nixon make a mistake in coming to China as a supplicant? And what has been the impact of the visit on the United States ever since?<br><br> Weaving together fascinating anecdotes and insights, an understanding of Chinese and American history, and the momentous events of an extraordinary time, this brilliantly written book looks at one of the transformative moments of the twentieth century and casts new light on a key relationship for the world of the twenty-first century. <b><br></b></p><p>Margaret MacMillan is the author of <i>Women of the Raj </i>and <i>Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World</i>, which won the Duff Cooper Prize, the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction, the Hessell-Tiltman Prize for History, a Silver Medal for the Arthur Ross Book Award of the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Governor General&#x2019;s Literary Award for nonfiction.

A small crowd, among them Vice President Spiro Agnew and his wife, Republican and Democratic congressmen, and the two Nixon daughters, Tricia and Julie, saw them off as they started the first leg of their long trip to China. The brief ceremony was carried live on American radio and television. Nixon spoke briefly. He was making, he said, &#x201c;a journey for peace,&#x201d; but, he added, he was under no illusions that &#x201c;twenty years of hostility between the People&#x2019;s Republic of China and the United States of America are going to be swept away by one week of talks that we will have there.&#x201d; Nevertheless, he was going in an optimistic spirit: &#x201c;If there is a postscript that I hope might be written with regard to this trip, it would be the words on the plaque which was left on the moon by our first astronauts when they landed there: &#x2018;We came in peace for all mankind.&#x2019; &#x201d; It was classic Nixon, that mixture of pragmatism and grandiloquence.<br><br>Inside the waiting plane at Andrews Air Force Base, the rest of Nixon&#x2019;s party, which included his secretary of state, William Rogers, and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, watched the ceremonies on television. Winston Lord, a young aide to Kissinger, joked nervously that if the plane blew up, they would all see themselves going sky high. As Nixon was boarding the plane, one of the waiting reporters handed him an atlas of China that had the seal of the CIA on its cover. &#x201c;Do you think they&#x2019;ll let me in with this?&#x201d; asked the president, sharing a rare joke with the press as he climbed aboard Air Force One.<br><br>He, the man who had made his name as a dogged and vociferous anti- Communist, was reversing two decades of American policy by traveling to Beijing, into the very heart of Chinese Communism. As the plane climbed into the air, Nixon felt like an explorer: &#x201c;We were embarking,&#x201d; he said in his memoirs, &#x201c;upon a voyage of philosophical discovery as uncertain, and in some respects as perilous, as the voyages of geographical discovery of a much earlier time period.&#x201d;<br><br>He was taking a considerable gamble: that conservatives at home would not attack him and that liberals would not be disappointed in the results of his trip. He was pleased by the many fervent messages he had received wishing him well&#x2014;but also concerned. &#x201c;I told Henry that I thought it really was a question of the American people being hopelessly and almost na�vely for peace, even at any price,&#x201d; he recalled. Kissinger was, as always, reassuring. Americans were excited by the boldness of Nixon&#x2019;s move.<br><br>Nixon also did not know whether the Chinese themselves would overcome their decades of hostility to the United States and make his visit a success. Although every detail of his trip had been negotiated with the Chinese, Nixon did not know, when he clambered aboard his plane, whether he would have a meeting with Chairman Mao Tse-tung, who, from his seclusion in Beijing, still controlled China. If Nixon came back to the United States without having met Mao, his trip would be regarded as a failure and, worse, a humiliation for the United States.<br><br>After the trip was over, the Nixon people always maintained that they&#x2019;d felt quite confident about a meeting. &#x201c;Well, we knew in our gut,&#x201d; said Winston Lord, &#x201c;that Mao would meet Nixon.&#x201d; The Americans had no firm promise, though, only vague assurances from the Chinese. &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Lord remembered, &#x201c;that we made unilateral statements that Nixon would, of course, be seeing Mao. We said that we would like to know when this would be, but we knew that this was going to happen. It would have been unthinkable if it didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>It was a gamble that Nixon was prepared to take because he felt that it was crucial for the United States. He had always taken risks&#x2014;as a young soldier in the army, when he passed the time (and made a lot of money) playing poker, and, later, as a politician. He had not spent those long and often difficult years making his way to the presidency to be a caretaker. And the United States needed some good news. The war in Vietnam had cost the country much, in lives, in money, and in reputation. It had led to deep divisions at home and a loss of influence and prestige abroad. The failure of the United States to finish, much less win, the war had contributed to a decline in American power. But it had only contributed; the extraordinary military and economic dominance that the United States had possessed from the end of the Second World War to the start of the 1960s could not last forever.<br><br>That dominance had been, in part, the product of the times. In 1945, other world powers lay defeated or, like Britain, so weakened by the huge costs of victory that they could no longer play a world role. The Soviet Union had great military strength and, by 1949, its own atomic bomb, but it had to make good the hideous costs of Hitler&#x2019;s invasion and of the war. By the end of the 1960s, though, western Europe and Japan had revived. The Soviet Union, although it would never be an economic power to match the United States, was investing heavily in its military. Newly independent countries such as India were playing their parts in the world. China&#x2019;s potential remained a question mark; the Communists had brought unity, but for much of the time since 1949 Mao&#x2019;s policies had sent the country down wasteful and destructive paths. Nevertheless, the Chinese revolution had become a model and an inspiration in many Third World countries.<br><br>Throughout the 1960s, Nixon worked on a political career that most people thought was over after his defeat by John F. Kennedy in the presidential race of 1960 and his even more humiliating failure to win the governorship of California in 1962. And he continued to develop his ideas on his favorite area of public policy, international relations. In the summer of 1967, he was invited to California to give the Lakeside Speech at Bohemian Grove, an institution that could only exist in North America, where rich and powerful men enjoy the arts and the simple, contemplative life for a couple of weeks in carefully rustic luxury. Nixon later said that he got more pleasure out of that speech&#x2014;&#x201c;the first milestone on my road to the presidency&#x201d;&#x2014;than any other in his career. In what would become known as the Nixon Doctrine, he argued that the United States could no longer afford to fight other nations&#x2019; wars. Although the United States would offer support, its allies must be prepared to stand on their own feet. On the other hand, there were encouraging signs on the world scene. The Soviet leaders were still striving for Communist domination of the world, but they did not want war with the United States. Moreover, the Communist monolith had broken apart and China and the Soviet Union were at loggerheads. Nixon came to this realization, he told Chou when they finally met, in those years in the 1960s when he was out of office and traveling about the world.<br><br>Nixon, it has often been said, especially by his supporters, was the only American president of the late twentieth century who could have taken advantage of the split in the Communist world and made the breakthrough in China-U.S. relations. The man and the times were right for each other. As Nixon himself once told an interviewer, the mark of a leader &#x201c;is whether he can give history a nudge.&#x201d; For the United States to refuse to deal with a major Asian power and one, moreover, that was the world&#x2019;s most populous country had never made much sense. As Nixon himself had written in a 1967 article in Foreign Affairs, &#x201c;Taking the long view, we simply cannot afford to leave China forever outside the family of nations, there to nurture its fantasies, cherish its hates and threaten its neighbors.&#x201d; In a revealing comparison, he said that dealing with China was like dealing with angry blacks in America&#x2019;s ghettos: &#x201c;In each case a potentially destructive force has to be curbed; in each case an outlaw element has to be brought within the law; in each case dialogues have to be opened.&#x201d; In the short term, China would simply have to be contained; in the longer term, though, it ought to be brought back into the community of nations. His article did not show the slightest sympathy for Chinese Communism; nor did it hold out much hope for an immediate change in China&#x2019;s relations with the world. By the time he was president, however, Nixon was starting to become more optimistic. In the election campaign, he repeated his warnings about the dangers of leaving China outside the international system and referred obliquely to it in his inaugural address in January 1969: &#x201c;We seek an open world&#x2014;open to ideas, open to the exchange of goods and people&#x2014;a world in which no people, great or small, will live in angry isolation.&#x201d;<br><br>By the early 1970s, both the United States and China realized that the world had changed and that they needed new friends. As Henry Kissinger, Nixon&#x2019;s national security adviser and close collaborator, wrote years later, &#x201c;For both sides necessity dictated that a rapprochement occur, and the attempt had to be made no matter who governed in either country.&#x201d; And while public opinion did not matter in China, it did in the United States, and Americans, by and large, no longer felt the antipathy and fear toward Chinese Communism that had been such a feature of American politics in the 1950s.<br><br>Moreover, Nixon had banked the political capital he needed at home. Dealing with Communists was always tricky during the Cold War. American public opinion had been slow to recognize the threat from the Soviet Union immediately after the Second World War, but once convinced that the threat was real, it had become seized with the idea that Communists were very powerful and that they were everywhere, in Russia, in the center of Europe, in Asia, and throughout American society. Nixon himself had ridden to power by calling to those fears, no matter how exaggerated they sometimes were. His anti-Communist credentials were beyond challenge. From the time he had first entered politics in California, running against the liberal Democrat Jerry Voorhis in 1946, he had charged that his opponents were soft on Communism or worse. Nixon&#x2019;s campaigning, with its insinuation and accusation and its reliance on unproven statistics and stories, won him the name &#x201c;Tricky Dick,&#x201d; but it worked. Americans listened to his repeated and forceful warnings about the threat that Communism posed to the United States and to American society. They watched as he stood up to Communists around the world, whether swapping boasts with the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in Moscow or defying the mobs who spat at him and tried to turn his car over in Venezuela.<br><br>Nixon&#x2019;s other great advantage was that he had the determination, the intelligence, and the knowledge to sense the currents in history and to take advantage of them. And he loved foreign policy. Indeed, he much preferred it to dealing with importunate congressmen and the minutiae of schools or highway building. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always thought this country could run itself domestically without a President,&#x201d; he told the journalist Theodore White in an interview during the presidential campaign. &#x201c;All you need is a competent Cabinet to run the country at home. You need a President for foreign policy; no Secretary of State is really important; the President makes foreign policy.&#x201d; While presidents had always given State of the Union addresses to Congress, Nixon also started making annual reports on the world situation. And he made it quite clear from the moment he took office that he was going to use an enhanced National Security Council to run major foreign policy issues out of the White House. His first appointment, the morning after his inauguration in January 1969, was with his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger. The first formal meeting he called was of his new NSC. Six weeks later, he was off on his first foreign trip, to see European leaders, among them a man he revered, Charles de Gaulle.<br><br>In the long and rambling conversations he had with his few intimates, Nixon returned constantly to the subject of the great leader, the man who boldly went on ahead, dragging his nation with him and changing the world. De Gaulle, of course. Winston Churchill&#x2014;a favorite, it seems, with many American presidents, including George W. Bush. And General George Patton. The movie, starring George C. Scott, was one of Nixon&#x2019;s favorites, and he kept a biography of Patton beside his bed. Such great leaders, in Nixon&#x2019;s view, were usually lonely and often misunderstood, but they nevertheless worked indefatigably to advance the interests of their nations. &#x201c;There were never tired decisions,&#x201d; he told Kissinger in one of their phone conversations, &#x201c;only tired commanders.&#x201d;<br><br>The world, with its great issues, was, for Nixon, where the leader could show what he was made of. He had prepared himself thoroughly for this moment. As vice president, he had traveled more than any of his predecesors; in the 1960s, before his run for president, when he was meant to be a private citizen, he had toured the world incessantly, meeting with local leaders and browbeating American diplomats as though he were still in office. A low-ranking foreign service officer who had to entertain him in Hong Kong remembered his &#x201c;tremendous intellectual curiosity.&#x201d; Nixon asked question after question, &#x201c;picking my brain for everything and anything I could tell him about China.&#x201d; Marshall Green, later assistant secretary of state with responsibility for East Asia during the Nixon administration, met Nixon in Indonesia in 1967 and had long conversations with him, which Nixon tape-recorded for later reference. &#x201c;I remembered him as the best informed on foreign affairs of all the luminaries who visited Jakarta during my four years there,&#x201d; Green said. The result of all the travel and the hours of questioning and conversation was that Nixon was the best-prepared president on foreign policy until Clinton. He also knew many foreign heads of state and foreign ministers personally.</p><h2>Maya: A Novel</h2><p>A stunning debut novel on sex, loss, and redemption.<br><br>It is 1975 and India is in turmoil.&nbsp;American Stanley Harrington arrives to study Sanskrit philosophy and escape his failing marriage.

However, <i>Maya</i> hit me hard so that I finished it in two days. I wasn&#x2019;t sure I wanted to go along on the ride, but moment by moment I was intrigued. <i>Maya</i> isn&#x2019;t fueled by pride or intellect, the usual grievous errors.

It&#x2019;s an uncommonly vital book.&#x201d; Author: Jim Harrison, author of Legends of the Fall<br><br>&#x201c;This is a marvelous book. Huntington brings India alive not as it is, not even as it was, but perfectly as those of us who studied and lived there long ago experienced it.<i> Maya</i> is a loving evocation of a place and time, and a powerfully honest expression of the enthusiasm and pain that attend passions of all kinds, whether for flesh or for truth. Most of all it is a splendid addition to the tradition of stories of how one met one&#x2019;s guru. This is life not as it is, and yet not otherwise; a perfect evocation of the world of illusion we actually inhabit.&#x201d; Author: Jay Garfield, author of Engaging Buddhism<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Maya</i> is a work of the imagination that presents itself as such, and simultaneously asks the reader to ponder how such imagination differs from what we understand as reality. This playfulness connects <i>Maya</i> to traditional East Asian literary practices&#x2014;such as the classic dream tale&#x2014;that are inspired by Buddhist theories of the imagination. This is fiction writing that is as philosophical as it is creative, and which turns art into religion without the preachiness or didacticism.&#x201d; Author: Francisca Cho, coauthor of Religion and Science in the Mirror of Buddhism<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been waiting for someone to write a contemporary &#x201c;quest for enlightenment&#x201d; novel, but didn&#x2019;t expect it to be this good. It evokes all the color and sensuousness&#x2014;the <i>feel&#x2014;</i>of 1970s India, along with the hard-won insights of what reads like a painfully honest memoir leading to a powerful conclusion.&#x201d; Author: David R.

As the final text in an ancient world religions course, this remarkable novel facilitated lively discussions of fictional truth, perception and the nature of reality, sexuality and spiritual awakening, experiential versus academic approaches to religious studies&#x2014;and it generated important student observations regarding cultural values in the East and West, as well as the exhilarations of expatriate life.&#x201d; Author: Mark S.

Nineteen years later, a rogue moon hurtling through space is about to obliterate the last opportunity to study this rare, life-supporting planet. With less than three weeks left before the disaster, superluminal pilot Priscilla "Hutch" Hutchins -- the only even remotely qualified professional within lightyears of the ill-fated planet -- must lead a small scientific team to the surface to glean whatever they can about its lifeforms and lost civilizations before time runs out. But catastrophe awaits when they are stranded on this strange and complex world of puzzles and impossibilities. And now Hutch and her people must somehow survive on a hostile world going rapidly mad -- as the clock ticks toward apocalypse for a doomed enigma now called...</p></p><p><i>Deepsix</i> is concerned with the motivating force that drives all scientists--the quest for truth, for expanding the limits of human knowledge. How much are we willing to risk for that moment of discovery, of knowing what no other soul yet knows? Our time? Our reputations? Our careers? Our lives? <p> The premise is this: just weeks before the planet Deepsix will be destroyed by a collision with a gas giant, ruins are detected on its surface, suggesting the presence of civilization. The Academy diverts scientists from the nearest spaceship to go down and explore, and they are joined by their century's Ellsworth Toohey: a misogynistic, sanctimonious gadfly who has never before been off of Earth's surface. The party's landers are destroyed in an earthquake induced by the approaching gas giant, so now they must find a way to get off of Deepsix before it is destroyed by the collision. Needless to say, their excavations are placed on the back burner.</p><p> The physics describing the space travel and the archeology used to reconstruct the lost culture of Deepsix are interesting and explained well. There is plenty of action and suspense--will the party survive? And the evolving characters and group dynamics are more complex than those usually found in science fiction books, making <i>Deepsix</i> a worthwhile read. <i>--Diana Gitig</i></p><p>Jack McDevitt is the author of <em>A Talent for War, The Engines of God, Ancient Shores, Eternity Road, Moonfall,</em> and numerous prize-winning short stories.

Unhappy marriages were, of course, even more vulgar, on a par with Mrs. Jeffries's special contraption that spanked forty bottoms at once: unspeakable, for half of the upper crust had experienced it firsthand.<br><br>No, the only kind of marriage that held up to life's vicissitudes was the courteous marriage. And it was widely recognized that Lord and Lady Tremaine had the most courteous marriage of them all.<br><br>In the ten years since their wedding, neither of them had ever uttered an unkind word about the other, not to parents, siblings, bosom friends, or strangers. Moreover, as their servants could attest, they never had spats, big or small; never embarrassed each other; never, in fact, disagreed on anything at all.<br><br>However, every year some cheeky debutante fresh from the schoolroom would point out&#x2014;as if it weren't common knowledge&#x2014;that Lord and Lady Tremaine lived on separate continents and had not been seen together since the day after their wedding.<br><br>Her elders would shake their heads. Foolish young girl. Wait 'til she heard about her beau's piece on the side. Or fell out of love with the man she married. Then she'd understand what a wonderful arrangement the Tremaines had: civility, distance, and freedom from the very beginning, unencumbered by tiresome emotions. Indeed, it was the most perfect marriage.<br><br>Therefore, when Lady Tremaine filed for divorce on grounds of Lord Tremaine's adultery and desertion, chins collided with dinner plates throughout London's most pedigreed dining rooms. Ten days later, as news circulated of Lord Tremaine's arrival on English soil for the first time in a decade, the same falling jaws dented many an expensive carpet from the heart of Persia.<br><br>The story of what happened next spread like a well-fed gut. It went something tantalizingly like this: A summons came at the Tremaine town house on Park Lane. Goodman, Lady Tremaine's faithful butler, answered the bell. On the other side of the door stood a stranger, one of the most remarkable-looking gentlemen Goodman had ever come across&#x2014;tall, handsome, powerfully built, an imposing presence.<br><br>"Good afternoon, sir," Goodman said placidly. A representative of the Marchioness of Tremaine, however impressed, neither gawked nor gushed.<br><br>He expected to be offered a calling card and a reason for the call. Instead, he was handed the gentleman's headgear. Startled, he let go of his hold on the doorknob and took the satin-trimmed top hat. In that instant, the man walked past him into the vestibule. Without a backward glance or an explanation for this act of intrusion, he began pulling off his gloves.<br><br>"Sir," Goodman huffed. "You do not have permission from the lady of the house to enter."<br><br>The man turned around and shot Goodman a glance that, to the butler's shame, made him want to curl up and whimper. "Is this not the Tremaine residence?"<br><br>"It is, sir." The reiteration of sir escaped Goodman, though he hadn't intended for it to happen.<br><br>"Then kindly inform me, since when does the master of the house require permission from the lady to enter into his own domain?" The man held his gloves together in his right hand and slapped them quietly against the palm of his left, as if toying with a riding crop.<br><br>Goodman didn't understand. His employer was the Queen Elizabeth of her time: one mistress and no master. Then the horror dawned. The man before him was the Marquess of Tremaine, the marchioness's long-absent, good-as-dead husband and heir to the Duke of Fairford.<br><br>"I do beg your pardon, sir." Goodman held on to his professional calm and took Lord Tremaine's gloves, though he was suddenly perspiring. "We have had no notice of your arrival. I shall have your chambers prepared immediately. May I offer you some refreshments in the meanwhile?"<br><br>"You may. And you may see to the unloading of my luggage," said Lord Tremaine. "Is Lady Tremaine at home?"<br><br>Goodman could not detect any unusual inflection in Lord Tremaine's tone. It was as if he had simply come in from an afternoon snooze at his club. After ten years! "Lady Tremaine is taking a constitutional in the park, sir."<br><br>Lord Tremaine nodded. "Very good."<br><br>Goodman instinctively trotted after him, the way he'd trail a feral beast if it happened to have made it past the front door. It was only half a minute later, as Lord Tremaine turned about and raised a brow, that Goodman realized he had already been dismissed.<br><br>***<br>Something about his wife's town house disturbed Lord Tremaine.<br><br>It was surprisingly elegant. He had half-expected to see the kind of interior he'd become accustomed to in the houses of his neighbors on lower Fifth Avenue: grandiose, gilded, aiming only to recall the last days of Versailles.<br><br>She had a few chairs from that era, but they had held their share of velvet-clad bottoms and looked comfortable rather than luxurious. Neither did he encounter the heavy sideboards and unchecked proliferation of bric-a-brac that were firmly associated, in his mind, with English homes.<br><br>If anything, her residence bore an uncanny resemblance to a certain villa in Turin, at the foot of the Italian Alps, in which he had spent a few happy weeks during his youth&#x2014;a house with wallpapers of soft antique gold and muted aquamarine, faience pots of orchids atop slender wrought-iron stands, and durable, well-made furniture from the previous century.<br><br>During an entire boyhood of decamping from one domicile to the next, the villa had been the only place, other than his grandfather's estate, where he'd felt at home. He had loved its brightness, its uncluttered comfort, and its abundance of indoor plants, their breath moist and herbaceous.<br><br>He was inclined to dismiss the echoing similarity between the two houses as a coincidence until his attention shifted to the paintings that adorned the walls of her drawing room. Between the Rubens, the Titian, and the ancestral portraits that occupied disproportionate acreage on English walls, she had hung pieces by the very same modern artists whose works he displayed in his own town house in Manhattan: Sisley, Morisot, Cassatt, and Monet, whose output had been infamously likened to unfinished wallpaper.<br><br>His pulse quickened in alarm. Her dining room featured more Monets and two Degases. Her gallery made it look as though she had bought an entire Impressionist exhibit: Renoir, Cezanne, Seurat, and artists no one had ever heard of outside the most gossipy circles of the Parisian art world.<br><br>He stopped midway down the gallery, suddenly unable to go on. She had furnished this house to be a fantasy-come-true for the boy he had been when he married her, the boy who must have mentioned, during their long hours of rapt conversation, something of his preference for understated houses and his love of modern art.<br><br>He remembered her spellbound concentration, her soft questions, her burning interest in everything about him.<br><br>Was the divorce but a new ruse, then? A cleverly sprung trap to re-ensnare him when all else had failed? Would he find her perfumed and naked on his bed when he threw open the door to his bedchamber?<br><br>He located the master's apartment and threw open the door.<br><br>There was no her, naked or otherwise, on his bed.<br><br>There was no bed.<br><br>And nothing else either. The bedchamber was as vast and empty as the American West.<br><br>The carpet no longer showed depressed spots where chair legs and bedposts had once stood. The walls betrayed no telltale rectangles of recently removed pictures. Thick layers of dust had settled on floor and windowsills. The room had stood vacant for years.<br><br>For no reason at all, he felt as if the breath had been kicked out of his lungs. The sitting room of the master's apartment was sparkling clean and fully equipped&#x2014;tuft-backed reading chairs, shelves laden with well-read books wrinkled at the spines, a writing desk freshly supplied with ink and paper, even a pot of amaranth in bloom. It made the void of the bedchamber all the more pointed, a barbed symbol.<br><br>The house might have been, once upon a time, designed with the single-minded goal of luring him back. But that was a different decade&#x2014;another age altogether. He had since been eviscerated from her existence.<br><br>He was still standing in the doorway, staring into the empty bedchamber, when the butler arrived, two footmen and a large portmanteau in tow. The nothingness of the chamber made the butler blush an extraordinary pink. "It will take us only an hour, sir, to air the chamber and restore the furnishing."<br><br>He almost told the butler not to bestir himself, to let the bedchamber remain stark and barren. But that would have said too much. So he only nodded. "Excellent."<br>***<br><br>The prototype of the new stamping machine Lady Tremaine had ordered for her factory in Leicestershire refused to live up to its promise. The negotiation with the shipbuilder in Liverpool dragged on most unsatisfactorily. And she had yet to answer any of the letters from her mother&#x2014;ten in all, one for each day since she'd petitioned for divorce&#x2014;in which Mrs. Rowland questioned her sanity outright and fell just short of comparing her intelligence to that of a leg of ham.<br><br>But that was all expected. What made her head pound was the telegram from Mrs. Rowland three hours ago: Tremaine came ashore at Southampton this morning. No matter how she tried to explain it to Freddie as something par for the course&#x2014;There are papers to sign and settlements to be negotiated, darling. He has to come back at some point&#x2014;Tremaine's arrival portended only trouble.<br>Her husband. In England. Closer than he had been in a decade, except for that miserable incident in Copenhagen, back in '88.<br><br>"I need Broyton to come in tomorrow morning to look at some accounts for me," she said to Goodman, handing over her shawl, her hat, and her gloves as she entered the town house and walked toward the library. "Kindly request Miss Etoile's presence for some dictations. And tell Edie that I will wear the cream velvet tonight, instead of the amethyst silk."<br><br>"Madam&#x2014;"<br><br>"I almost forgot. I saw Lord Sutcliffe this morning. His secretary has given notice. I recommended your nephew. Have him present himself at Lord Sutcliffe's house tomorrow morning at ten. Tell him that Lord Sutcliffe prefers a man of sincerity and few words."<br><br>"That is too kind of you, madam!" Goodman exclaimed.<br><br>"He's a promising young man." She stopped before the library door. "On second thought, have Miss Etoile come in twenty minutes. And make sure no one disturbs me until then."<br><br>"But your ladyship, his lordship&#x2014;"<br><br>"His lordship will not be taking tea with me today." She pushed the door open and realized Goodman was still there, hovering. She turned halfway and glanced at him. The butler wore a constipated expression. "What is it, Goodman? The back troubling you again?"<br><br>"No, madam, it's not. It's&#x2014;"<br><br>"It's me," said a voice from inside the library. Her husband's voice.<br><br>For a long, stunned moment, all she could think was how glad she was that she had not invited Freddie home with her today, as she often did after an afternoon walk together. Then she could not think of anything at all. Her headache faded, replaced by a mad rush of blood to her head. She was hot, then cold. The air about her turned thick as pea soup, fine for gulping but impossible to inhale.<br>Vaguely, she nodded at Goodman. "You may return to your duties."<br><br>Goodman hesitated. Did he fear for her? She entered the library and let the heavy oak door close behind her, shutting out curious eyes and ears, shutting out the rest of the world.<br><br>The windows of her library faced west, for a view of the park. The still-intense sunlight cascaded through clear glass panes at an oblique angle and landed in perfect rectangles of warm clarity on her Samarkand carpet, with its poppies and pomegranates on a field of rose and ivory.<br><br>Tremaine stood just beyond the direct light, his hands braced against the mahogany desk behind him, his long legs crossed at the ankles. He should be a figure in relative obscurity, not particularly visible. Yet she saw him all too clearly, as if Michelangelo's Adam had leapt off the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, robbed a Savile Row bespoke tailor, and come to make trouble.<br><br>She caught herself. She was staring, as if she was still that nineteen-year-old girl, devoid of depth but full of herself.<br><br>"Hullo, Camden."<br><br>"Hullo, Gigi."<br><br>She had allowed no man to call her by that childhood pet name since his departure.<br><br>Forcing herself away from the door, she crossed the length of the library, the carpet beneath her feet too soft, a quagmire. She marched right up to him, to show that she did not fear him. But she did. He held powers over her, powers far beyond those conferred by mere laws.<br><br>Even though she was a tall woman, she had to tilt her head to look him in the eye. His eyes were a dark, dark green, like malachite from the Urals. She inhaled his subtle scent of sandalwood and citrus, the aroma she had once equated with happiness.<br><br>"Are you here to grant me the divorce or to be a nuisance?" She got to the point right away. Trouble that was not confronted head-on always circled around to bite one in the bum.<br><br>He shrugged. He had taken off his day coat and his necktie. Her gaze lingered one second too long on the golden skin at the base of his neck. His shirt of fine cambric draped over him lovingly, caressing his wide shoulders and long arms.<br><br>"I'm here to set conditions."<br><br>"What do you mean, conditions?"<br><br>"An heir. You produce an heir and I will allow the divorce to proceed. Otherwise I will name parties to your adultery. You do know that you cannot divorce me on grounds of adultery if you happen to have committed the same sin, don't you?"<br><br>Her ears rang. "Surely you jest. You want an heir from me? Now?"<br><br>"I couldn't stand the thought of bedding you before now."<br><br>"Really?" She laughed, though she'd have preferred to smash an inkwell against his temple. "You liked it well enough last time."<br><br>"The performance of a lifetime," he said easily. "And I was a good thespian to begin with."<br><br>Pain erupted inside her, corrosive, debilitating pain she'd thought she'd never feel again. She groped for mastery and shoved the subject away from where she was most vulnerable. "Empty threats. I have not been intimate with Lord Frederick."<br><br>"How chaste of you. I speak of Lord Wrenworth, Lord Acton, and the Honorable Mr. Williams."<br><br>She sucked in a breath. How did he know? She'd been ever so careful, ever so discreet.</p><h2>Girl Genius Volume 9: Agatha Heterodyne and The Heirs of the Storm SC (Girl Genius, 9)</h2><p><ul> <li>Adventure, Romance, Mad Science!

The days when his captors used his suffering to teach the arcane art of interrogation might cost him his sanity, even his honor, but they also ensured he would some day, some night, some eternity if necessary, have that sweetest of satisfactions-revenge.</p> <p>"You see before you the mortal form of a once great and powerful man, Corporal," Girard said, pacing slowly between the table his prisoner had been lashed to and the damp stone wall where the corporal stood at attention.</p> <p>Girard was a stranger to hurry, a necessary trait in a torturer. A big, dark, lean acolyte of the Corsican, Girard lived in Christian's awareness the way consumption dwelled in the minds of those it afflicted.</p> <p>"Our duke is still great, to my mind," Girard went on, "because His Grace has not, as the English say, broken."</p> <p>Girard blathered on in his subtly accented French, and despite willing it to the contrary, Christian translated easily. As Girard's ironic praise and patriotic devotion blended in a curiously mesmerizing patter, Girard's superior, Henri Anduvoir-the actual intended student-lurked off in the shadows.</p> <p>Bad luck in a man's superiors was not the exclusive province of Wellington's army. Girard made a science of extracting truth from those reluctant to part with it, and pain was only one tool at his disposal.</p> <p>Anduvoir, a simpler and in some ways more-evil soul, was plainly addicted to hurting others for his own entertainment.</p> <p>Christian filled his mind with the lovely truth that someday Anduvoir, too, would be made to suffer, and suffer, and suffer.</p> <p>"Yet. Our duke has not broken yet," Girard went on. "I challenge you, Corporal, to devise the torment or the prize that will break him, but be mindful that our challenge grows the longer His Grace is silent. When the good God above put Mercia into our hands all those months ago, we sought to know through which pass Wellington would move his troops. We know now, so what, I ask you, is the point of the exercise? Why not simply toss this living carcass to the wolves?"</p> <p>Yes, please God, why not?</p> <p>And then another thought intruded on Christian's efforts to distance himself from the goings-on in that cell: Was Girard letting slip that Wellington had, in fact, moved troops into France itself? Girard played a diabolical game of cat and mouse, hope and despair, in a role that blended tormenter and protector with a subtlety a better-fed man might find fascinating.</p> <p>"We yet enjoy His Grace's charming company because the duke serves another purpose," Girard prosed on. "He did not break, so we must conclude he is sent here to teach us the breaking of a strong man. One might say, an inhumanly strong man. Now..."</p> <p>The scent of rich Turkish tobacco wafted to Christian's nose, cutting through the fragrance of lavender Girard favored and the perpetual damp of the Ch�teau's lower reaches. Christian's meager breakfast threatened a reappearance, a helpful development in truth. He focused not on Girard's lilting, philosophical French, but on holding the nausea at bay, for he had reason to know a man could choke on his own vomit.</p> <p>A boot scraped, and by senses other than sight, Christian divined that Anduvoir had come out of his shadows, a reptile in search of his favorite variety of heat.</p> <p>"Enough lecturing, Colonel Girard. Your pet has not told us of troop movements. In fact, the man no longer talks at all, do you, mon duc?" Anduvoir sucked a slow drag of his cigar, then gently placed the moist end of it against Christian's lips. "I long for the sound of even one hearty English scream. Long for it desperately."</p> <p>Christian turned his head away in a response Girard, who was by no means a stupid man, would have predicted. Anduvoir was an infrequent visitor, though, and like any attentive host-or prudent subordinate-Girard trotted out the best entertainments for his guest.</p> <p>Anduvoir moved into Christian's line of sight, which, given the careful lack of expression on Girard's face, was bad news all around. Anduvoir was short, dark, coarse featured, and behind his Gallic posturing, suffused with the glee of a bully whose victim could not elude torment.</p> <p>"A quiet man, our duke." Anduvoir expelled smoke through his nose. "Or perhaps, not so quiet."</p> <p>He laid the burning tip of the cigar against the soft skin inside Christian's elbow with the same care he'd put it to his prisoner's mouth, letting a small silence mark the moment when the scent of scorched flesh rose.</p> <p>The blinding, searing pain howled from Christian's arm to his mind, where it joined the memory of a thousand similar pains and coalesced into one roaring chant:</p> <p>Revenge!</p> <p>***</p> <p>"Lord Greendale was a man of great influence," Dr. Martin said, clearing his throat in a manner Gilly was coming to loathe, the way she'd loathed the sight of Greendale lighting one of his foul cheroots in her private parlor.</p> <p>"His lordship enjoyed very great influence," Gilly concurred, eyes down, as befit a woman facing the widowed state.</p> <p>The bad news came exactly as expected: "You should prepare for an inquest, my lady."</p> <p>"An inquest?" Gilly gestured for her guest to take a seat, eight years of marriage to Greendale having taught her to produce an appearance of calm at will. "Theophilus, the man of great influence was universally disliked, approaching his threescore and ten, and the victim of an apoplexy in the midst of a formal dinner for twenty-eight of his most trusted toadies. What will an inquest serve?"</p> <p>Since Greendale's apoplexy, Gilly had dared to order that the fires in her parlor be kept burning through the day, and yet, the physician's words chilled her more effectively than if a window had banged open.</p> <p>"Lady Greendale..." Martin shifted a black satchel from right hand to left, making the contents rattle softly. Gilly was convinced the only items of interest in that bag were a selection of pocket flasks.</p> <p>"Countess, you must not speak so freely, even to me. I will certainly be put under oath and questioned at length. I cannot imagine what the wrong words in the hands of the lawyers will do to your reputation."</p> <p>His wrong words, over which he'd have no control, of course. A just God would afflict such a physician with a slow, painful death.</p> <p>"Reputation matters little if one is to swing for murder."</p> <p>"It won't come to that," Martin said, but he remained poised by the door, bag in hand, as if lingering in Gilly's presence might taint him not with her guilt-for she was innocent of wrongdoing toward her late spouse-but with her vulnerability to accusations. "I had Harrison consult on the case, and he confirmed my diagnosis by letter not two days after the apoplexy."</p> <p>Dr. Theophilus Martin had observed this precaution not because he was intent on safeguarding Greendale's young widow, but because his late, unlamented lordship had created an air of mistrust thick enough to pollute every corner of the house.</p> <p>"What am I to be charged with?" Stupidity, certainly, for having married Greendale, but Gilly's family had been adamant-"You'll be a countess!"-and she'd been so young...</p> <p>Dr. Martin smoothed a soft hand over snow-white hair. "You are not accused of anything."</p> <p>His lengthy, silent examination of the framed verses of Psalm 23 hanging over the sideboard confirmed that Gilly would, indeed, face suspicion. Her life had become a series of accusations grounded in nothing more than an old man's febrile imagination, and he'd made those accusations where any servant might have overheard them.</p> <p>"They will say I put a pillow over his face, won't they?"</p> <p>"They can't. You had a nurse in the room at all times, didn't you? Lovely stitch work, my lady."</p> <p>Gilly had been accompanied by two nurses, as often as possible, and the stitch work would go to the poorhouse as soon as the inquest was over.</p> <p>"If I was with his lordship, a nurse was always present-or you, yourself. Will the nurses be suspect?"</p> <p>She did not ask if Martin would come under suspicion, because quite honestly, she was too afraid to care. He'd been summoned to Greendale Hall on many occasions, and had socialized with Lord Greendale as often as he'd treated him. His solicitude of Gilly now likely had to do with seeing his substantial bill paid.</p> <p>"I hired the nurses based on my personal experience of them, so no, I shouldn't think they'll come under suspicion," Martin said.</p> <p>Because the physician was eyeing the door, Gilly fired off the most important question, and to Hades with dignity.</p> <p>"Who's behind this, Theophilus? My husband is not yet put in the ground, and already you're telling me of an inquest."</p> <p>Though thank a merciful Deity, Martin's torpid humanitarian instincts had resulted in this warning, at least. Another smoothing of his leonine mane followed, while the fingers of his left hand tightened on the black leather handle tellingly.</p> <p>"I thought it the better part of kindness not to burden you with this news prematurely, but Lord Greendale himself apparently told his heir to see to the formalities."</p> <p>And to think Gilly had prayed for her husband's recovery. "Easterbrook ordered this? He's still in France or Spain or somewhere serving the Crown."</p> <p>"As heir to Lord Greendale's title and fortune, Marcus Easterbrook would have left instructions with his solicitors, and they would in turn have been in communication with King's Counsel and the local magistrate."</p> <p>Men. Always so organized when bent on aggravation and aspersion. "Greendale was the magistrate. To whom does that dubious honor fall now?"</p> <p>"Likely to Squire Gordon."</p> <p>Gordon was a hounds-and-horses fellow, and he'd never toadied to Greendale. A fraction of Gilly's panic eased.</p> <p>"Shall you have some tea, Theophilus? It's good and hot." Also strong for a change, Gilly's second act of independence from the infernal economies Greendale had imposed on her.</p> <p>"Thank you, my lady, but no." Martin turned toward the door, then hesitated, hand on the latch.</p> <p>"You needn't tarry, Theophilus. You've served the family loyally, and that has been far from easy." He'd served the family discreetly, too. Very discreetly. "I suppose I'll see you at the inquest."</p> <p>He nodded once and slipped away, confirming that he would not call in even a professional capacity before the legalities were resolved, not if he wanted to maintain the appearance of impartiality. Not if he wanted to keep the Crown's men from turning their sights on him as well.</p> <p>Gilly added coal to the fire-rest in peace, Lord Greendale-and stared into the flames for long moments, weighing her very few options as best one could weigh options when in a flat, terrified panic.</p> <p>As her strong, hot tea grew tepid in the pot, she sat down with pen and ink, and begged an interview with Gervaise Stoneleigh, the coldest, most astute, most expensive barrister ever to turn down Greendale's coin.</p> <p>And that decision very likely saved her life.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"Girard gave me final orders concerning you."</p> <p>Christian turned his head slowly. He was still recovering from the last teaching day, a sorry effort on the corporal's part, consisting of familiar tortures enthusiastically applied the better to impress Anduvoir, while Girard had stood bristling with silent censure.</p> <p>Girard did not approve of brute maneuvers that produced no results, and one had to respect Girard's sense of efficiency.</p> <p>"You don't care that Girard might have given me orders to kill you, do you?"</p> <p>The jailer sounded Irish, or on rare occasions when nobody else was about, Scottish, and Christian admitted-in the endless privacy of his thoughts-to being grateful to hear English in any accent other than French.</p> <p>And typical of Girard's cunning, the jailer was also a frequent source of small kindnesses intended to torment the prisoner with that most cruel weapon: hope.</p> <p>"Girard said I'm not to allow you to suffer, on account of what's gone before. Said you'd earned your battle honors, so to speak, though it would be a mercy to allow you to join your duchess and your son. He said you're a man who can trust no one, and the life that awaits you won't be worth living for long, assuming your enemies don't ambush you from the hedges of Surrey."</p> <p>Ah. The old lie, for Christian had no enemies in Surrey, and his wife and son yet thrived at home in England. Severn was a veritable fortress, staffed by retainers whose loyalty went back generations. Girard was simply a petty evil allowed to flourish in the bowels of the Grand Arm�e's outpost on the slopes of the Pyrenees, and this claim that Helene and Evan were dead was merely a blunt weapon in Girard's arsenal.</p> <p>Which Girard would pay for using.</p> <p>Christian focused on ignoring the man speaking to him, a big blond fellow with watchful green eyes and a wary devotion to Girard. Girard referred to him as "Michel"; the other guards quietly referred to him in less affectionate terms.</p> <p>The jailer held a gleaming, bone-handled knife, its presence a matter of complete indifference to Christian-almost. The knife had become something of a friend to Christian-for a time-until Anduvoir had found a use for it no man could contemplate sanely.</p> <p>"Orthez fell in February," the jailer said, still lingering near the open door of the cell-a taunt, that, leaving the cell door unlatched when Christian was powerless to escape. "That was weeks ago, not that you'd know, poor sod. Bordeaux was last month. Toulouse has been taken, and we've heard rumors Napoleon has abdicated. Girard's gone."</p> <p>None of it was true. These fairy tales were a variation on the stories the jailer told from time to time in an effort to raise hopes. Christian knew better: hopes that refused to rise couldn't be dashed.</p> <p>The jailer came no closer.</p> <p>"I've seen what went on here, and I'm sorry for it," he said, sounding Scottish indeed, and damnably sincere. "Girard is sorry for it, too. This was war, true enough, but when Anduvoir came around..."</p> <p>But nothing. Christian was tied to the cot, a periodic nuisance he'd long since become inured to. Girard's greatest cruelty had been to show his prisoner only enough care to ensure Christian wouldn't die. The mattress was thin but clean, and Christian probably had more blankets than the infantry quartered elsewhere in the old ch�teau.</p> <p>He was fed.</p> <p>If he refused to eat, he was fed by force. If he refused to bathe, he was bathed by force as well. If he refused his occasional sortie into the ch�teau's courtyard, where fresh air and sunshine assaulted his senses every bit as brutally as the guards assaulted his body, he was escorted there by force.</p> <p>Eventually, the force had been unnecessary, for a man strong enough to escape was a man who preserved the hope of revenge, and Christian wanted to remain that strong. He endured the fresh air and sunlight, he ate the food given him by his captors, nourishing not himself, but his dreams of revenge.</p> <p>Girard had understood that too, and had understood how to manipulate even that last, be...</p></p><h2>Brutal Journey: Cabeza de Vaca and the Epic First Crossing of North America</h2><p><p><b>"Schneider's thorough research and vivid writing create a fast-paced, moving story, one that is difficult to believe and impossible to forget." </b><br><b>&#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p>A gripping survival epic, <i>Brutal Journey</i> tells the story of an army of would-be conquerors, bound for glory, who landed in Florida in 1528.

They promptly disappeared without a trace into the swamps and, except for a small contingent that remained on board the ships, were soon assumed to be dead. But then, eight years and thousands of miles later, three Spaniards and a Moroccan wandered out of what is now the United States into what was then Cort�s&#x2019;s gold-drenched Mexico.<br><br>They brought nothing back from their sojourn in the &#x201c;unknown&#x201d; north other than their story, for as one of them said later, &#x201c;This alone is what a man who came away naked could carry out with him.&#x201d; But what a tale it was. Since leaving Tampa Bay, they and their dwindling company of comrades had become killers and cannibals, torturers and torture victims, slavers and enslaved. They became faith healers, arms dealers, canoe thieves, spider eaters, and finally, when there were only the four of them left trudging across the high Texas desert, they became itinerant messiahs. They became, in other words, whatever it took to stay alive long enough to inch their way across the continent toward Mexico, the only place they were certain they would find an outpost of the Spanish Empire.<br><br>Though well known to scholars of the European invasion of the New World, P�nfilo de Narv�ez&#x2019;s expedition to Florida is surprisingly unfamiliar to most North Americans. Part of the reason, no doubt, is the relative dearth of eyewitness accounts, a not-unexpected situation given the small number of survivors and the absence of even oral traditions reflecting the Native American perspective. There are only two firsthand narratives of the mission, both flawed in their own way and both European in origin. Best known is the astonishing personal memoir of the expedition&#x2019;s treasurer, �lvar N��ez Cabeza de Vaca, whose primary goal in writing was to convince the king that he deserved to be rewarded for his sufferings and services to the crown. The other is a shorter, official report that was prepared jointly by the survivors not long after their return; unfortunately, it exists only in a paraphrased form in an early Spanish history of the Indies.<br><br>Attempting to bring some possible version of the truth into focus through these two documents alone would be like trying to discern the craters of the moon through a telescope rigged out of two lenses salvaged from two different optical devices. It&#x2019;s a useful and theoretically possible exercise, but often more tantalizing in the questions it opens up than authoritative about some objective &#x201c;reality.&#x201d; Fortunately, further details about the expedition can be inferred from the many other, better-documented Spanish intrusions into the region during the same period. Decisions made by Narv�ez can be compared and contrasted to those of his peers in similar situations, giving rise to a far more nuanced image of the commander than the traditional one of a bungling and vicious buffoon. Likewise, Cabeza de Vaca is not, in the end, quite as unerringly faithful and righteous as his own memory might suggest.<br><br>Hints about the lives and livelihoods of the various Native Americans encountered by the travelers surface in archeological reports and dissertations. What&#x2019;s been learned in the last fifty years about the original inhabitants of Florida, in particular, opens the door to a more evenhanded image of the encounter between the conquistadors and the Indians. Likewise, high-tech research into the nature and volume of pre-Columbian trade within the Americas sheds new light on Cabeza de Vaca&#x2019;s temporary career as a peddler. In Texas and Mexico, meanwhile, a century of academic debates over the probable route of the survivors has finally coalesced into something resembling consensus.<br><br>And finally, for the interested person, the saw grass shallows of the Florida Panhandle are still there to wade out into. Thunderous downpours still roll in off the baked lands outside Laredo, Texas. Some of the plants may have changed, but the Sierra Madre remain.<br><br>The end result is a mosaic of pedigreed &#x201c;facts&#x201d; that when viewed as a whole bring a plausible rendering of the story to life. It&#x2019;s a daunting and occasionally frustrating undertaking; in a work of nonfiction there are always some tiles missing from the mosaic. Nonetheless, the story of the Narv�ez expedition is well worth the effort, and not only because the ordeal of the four who survived constitutes one of the greatest survival epics of all time. Or because they were arguably the first from the &#x201c;Old World&#x201d; to cross the continent of North America. Or that their journey and their stories inspired the better-known expeditions of De Soto and Coronado that followed them.<br><br>Beyond the day-to-day drama of the journey, what the Narv�ez survivors saw and said they saw provides a tantalizing glimpse of native North America in the moments before the waves of disease and dislocation began to change forever the human makeup of the continent. When fleshed out with what is known from other sources, the glimpse becomes something closer to a vision, and the journeyers--lost though they mostly were--become unintentional guides to a now lost New World.<br><br>It was a world populated by neither &#x201c;noble savages&#x201d; nor &#x201c;bad Indians.&#x201d; As the survivors made their way from Florida to the Pacific, and then south, they met a dizzying array of peoples, some cruel enough to pluck men&#x2019;s beards out for pleasure, others kind enough to carry dying strangers to warm fires. Some were seemingly well off, dressed in fine furs and extravagant feather-work, others were desperately poor, their bellies bloated from hunger. And it wasn&#x2019;t just the residents of the New World that confronted the audacious newcomers; there were hurricanes and lightning, raging rivers, scorching deserts, and venomous vipers. This precontact North America--land, water, weather, and people--is the true protagonist of the story, against which the lives and dreams of the four hundred would-be conquerors are bent and twisted and, in all but a very few cases, extinguished.<br><br>For the expeditionaries setting out from Spain in 1527, North America began as an imagined place where they would find fabulous empires of gold: perhaps the seven lost cities supposedly settled by Portuguese bishops fleeing Muslim invaders in the early Middle Ages, or the fabled lands of the Amazon warriors, or even the fictional island of California. They would find nations of peoples waiting to be &#x201c;liberated&#x201d; from their heathen ways and ultimately thankful to be brought into the fold of &#x201c;civilization,&#x201c; even if blood had to be spilled to convince them. In the process, the adventurers believed they would become wealthy beyond anything possible if they stayed home. Coming out of a seven-hundred-year tradition of privateer warfare against the Islamic Moors in Spain--the &#x201c;reconquest&#x201d;--they saw no conflict between fighting for their ideals and their pocketbooks at the same time. They were going to North America &#x201c;to serve God and the king,&#x201c; as one of their contemporaries said, &#x201c;and also to get rich.&#x201d;<br><br>As citizens of the strongest nation in Europe, an empire entering its golden age with a destiny ordained by the pope himself, the conquistadors had everything they needed to make it happen. They had the superior weapons, the legal structure, the philosophical framework, the experience, the private capital, and most of all they had the desire, hubris, and zeal. But in the end, on the ground in North America, for Narv�ez and his followers it wasn&#x2019;t enough. Even before they landed in Florida, reality slowly but methodically began stripping them of everything they thought they were and remaking them into something altogether strange and new. In the case of one of the survivors, the Moroccan slave Esteban, also called &#x201c;the Black,&#x201c; the change was apparently irreversible.<br><br>All history is hindsight, of course, and in hindsight it&#x2019;s easy to say the hundreds who followed Narv�ez to their doom in the quagmire were fools following a fool. They probably were. But history also attempts to understand, and in 1527 there were plenty of reasons to leave the land of no-opportunity that was home and to believe in Narv�ez and join his mission to America. He was a seasoned and well-connected commander who had already played a major and bloody role in conquering the Caribbean, and had gotten rich doing so. More importantly to the rank and file, only seven years had passed since Cort�s had conquered Montezuma&#x2019;s empire, and the fleets stuffed with treasure and rumor arriving from Mexico reignited the frenzy of interest in New World conquests that had flagged in the disappointing decades immediately following Columbus&#x2019;s discoveries. Where there was one such bonanza, there was sure to be another; and if Narv�ez and his army didn&#x2019;t go find it, others inevitably would. So the hundreds signed on to go to La Florida and told their loved ones not to worry.<br><br>Such historical &#x201c;inevitabilities,&#x201c; driven as they are by great economic forces and social trends, are modern history&#x2019;s stock in trade. But in the end, they are only the stage on which real lives of pain and pleasure were played out, lives that were defined by various egos and varying abilities, and to some measure by chance. For Narv�ez himself, the connection to Cort�s and Mexico was far more than simply inspirational. It was personal and direct, remembered with a wince each day whenever he put a hand up to his ruined eye socket. No, it was beyond personal; it was obsessive.<br><br>So the story begins not in Spain or in Florida, but in the Totonic city of Cempoallan, on the Gulf Coast of Mexico in the year 1520, ...</p></p><h2>The Portage to San Cristobal of A.

She had a lonely heart, an estranged son, and a big secret. Reacher, working with a woman cop and a host of shadowy feds, wants to know just how big a hole Susan Mark was in, how many lives had already been twisted before hers, and what danger is looming around him now.</p> <p>Because a race has begun through the streets of Manhattan in a maze crowded with violent, skilled soldiers on all sides of a shadow war. Susan Mark&#x2019;s plain little life was critical to dozens of others in Washington, California, Afghanistan . . . from a former Delta Force operator now running for the U.S. Senate, to a beautiful young woman with a fantastic story to tell&#x2013;and to a host of others who have just one thing in common: They&#x2019;re all lying to Reacher. A little. A lot. Or maybe just enough to get him killed.</p> <p>In a novel that slams through one hairpin surprise after another, Lee Child unleashes a thriller that spans three decades and gnaws at the heart of America . . . and for Jack Reacher, a man who trusts no one and likes it that way, it&#x2019;s a mystery with only one answer&#x2013;the kind that comes when you finally get face-to-face and look your worst enemy in the eye.</p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive Essay: Lee Child on <i>Gone Tomorrow</i></strong><br><br> My career as a writer has been longer than some and shorter than others, but it happens to span the internet era more or less exactly. My first book, <i>Killing Floor</i>, came out in 1997. It probably sold some copies on Amazon, but not many, because the company was in its infancy then, barely two years old. In that book I even referred to &#x201c;an e-mail,&#x201d; thinking I was showing two of the characters to be amazingly cutting-edge and modern.<br> <p>A year or so later I actually got e-mail, and a year or so after that I got a web site, and a couple of years after that I got broadband, and over the following few years I got into the habit of starting the day internet surfing, reading the news and the gossip.</p> <p>But it is not until now that I can say that one of my books--the thirteenth Reacher thriller, <i>Gone Tomorrow</i>--is truly and exclusively a product of the internet age.</p> <p>I started the surfing years in a sensible, structured manner, but I eventually learned that the best stuff comes randomly. I started to follow links on a whim, bouncing from place to place, Googling other people&#x2019;s references, following the maze, looking for rabbit holes.</p> <p>I found an anonymous police blog from Britain.</p> <p>It was apparently hosted by a London copper, and because it was secure and anonymous it was uninhibited. The people who posted there said all kinds of things. There were complaints and there was bitching, of course, but also there was a frank and unexpurgated view of police work from behind the lines. I got there in the summer of 2005, just after the suicide bombings on London&#x2019;s transportation system, and just after a completely innocent Brazilian student had been shot to death by London police, who were under the mistaken impression that the guy had been involved.</p> <p>Now, as a thriller writer, I&#x2019;m familiar with the idea that cops can be bent or reckless. But I&#x2019;m equally aware that&#x2019;s mostly literary license. I know lots of cops, and they&#x2019;re great people doing a very tough job. Years ago I met a friend&#x2019;s eight-year-old daughter--a sweet little girl with no front teeth--and she grew up to be a cop. She won a bravery medal for a difficult solo arrest during which she was stabbed and had her thumb broken. She&#x2019;s tough, but she&#x2019;s not bent or reckless. So are the other cops I know.</p> <p>So I was curious: what happened with the Brazilian kid? How was the mistake made?</p> <p>So I eavesdropped while the coppers on the anonymous site were asking the same question. And I learned something interesting.</p> <p>Their first consensus explanation was: because of &#x201c;the list.&#x201d; The Brazilian boy was showing &#x201c;all twelve signs.&#x201d; I thought, what list? What signs? So I clicked and scrolled and Googled, and it turned out that years earlier Israeli counterintelligence had developed a failsafe checklist of physical and behavioral signifiers, that when all present and correct mean you are looking at a suicide bomber. The list had entered training manuals, and after 9/11 those manuals were studied like crazy all over the world. And the response was mandatory: you see a guy showing the signs, you put him down, right now, before he can blow himself up.</p> <p>And by sheer unlucky coincidence, the Brazilian kid had been showing the signs. A winter coat in July, a recent shave, and so on. (Read <i>Gone Tomorrow</i> if you want to know all twelve, and why.) </p> <p>All writing is what if? So I tried to imagine that moment of... disbelief, I guess. You see a guy showing the signs, and probably every fiber of your being is saying, &#x201c;This can&#x2019;t be.&#x201d; But you&#x2019;re required to act.</p> <p>So for the opening scene of <i>Gone Tomorrow</i>, I had Reacher sitting on a subway train in New York City, staring at a woman who is showing the signs. Reacher is ex-military law enforcement, and he knows the list forward and backward. Half of his brain is saying, &#x201c;This can&#x2019;t be,&#x201d; and the other half is programmed to act. What does he do? What if he&#x2019;s wrong? What will happen?</p> <p>That&#x2019;s where the story starts. It ends hundreds of pages later, in a place you both do and don&#x2019;t expect. --<i>Lee Child</i></p> <p>(Photo � Sigrid Estrada)</p>Lee Child is one of the world&#39;s leading thriller writers.

Tronto, argues in <i>Who Cares?</i> that we need to rethink American democracy, as well as our own fundamental values and commitments, from a caring perspective. Asserting that Americans are facing a "caring deficit"&#x2015;that there are simply too many demands on our time to care adequately for children, elderly people, and ourselves&#x2015;she asks us to reconsider how we allocate care responsibilities. At the same time, while democratic politics should help citizens to care better, most people see caring as unsupported by public life and deem the concerns of politics as too remote from their lives to make a difference in this sphere. Tronto traces the reasons for this disconnect and argues for the need to make care, not economics, the central concern of democratic political life.</p></p><p><p>Joan C. Tronto is Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota. She is the author of <i>Caring Democracy: Markets, Equality, and Justice.</i></p><p>"The Institute chose to celebrate Joan C. Tronto's work because it forces people to rethink the obligations we have to one another in democratic societies. Modern rhetoric about democracy places due emphasis on personal freedom, but responsibilities can get overlooked. Tronto also stresses that caring for one another is less a burden than a fulfilling act, which reminds us all of how dependent we are on one another across the country and across the generations."</p> (John Gastil, Director, McCourtney Institute for Democracy)</p><h2>Once Upon a Time in Shaolin: The Untold Story of Wu-Tang Clan&#39;s Million-Dollar Secret Album, the Devaluation of Music, and America&#39;s New Public Enemy No. 1</h2><p><p><b>The untold story of the world's most controversial album---a surreal tale of secret recordings, the Wu-Tang Clan, baffled customs agents, the world's most hallowed art institutions, and a villain of comic book proportions: Martin Shkreli.</b></p><p>In 2007, the innovative young Wu-Tang producer, Cilvaringz, took an incendiary idea to his mentor the RZA. They felt that the impact of digitization threatened the sustainability of the record industry and independent artists, while shifting the perception of music from treasured works of art to disposable consumer products. </p><p>Together they conceived a statement so radical that it would unleash a torrent of global debate---a sole copy of an album in physical form, encased in gleaming silver and sold through an auction house for millions as a work of contemporary art.</p><p>The execution of this plan raised a number of complex questions: Would selling an album for millions be the ultimate betrayal of music? How would fans react to an album that's sold on the condition that it could not be commercialized? And could anyone ever justify the selling of the album to the infamous Martin Shkreli?</p><p>As headlines flashed across the globe, the mystery only deepened. Opinions were sharply divided over whether this was high art or hucksterism---quixotic idealism or a cynical cash grab. Was it a noble act of protest, an act of cultural vandalism, an obscene symbol of greed, a subversive masterpiece, a profound mirror for our time, or a joker on capitalism's card table? </p><p>As senior adviser to the project, Cyrus Bozorgmehr is uniquely placed to unlock the secrets behind the album and tell the full, unadulterated story. </p><p>With explosive revelations about backroom plans made public for the first time, <i>Once Upon a Time in Shaolin</i> charts the album's journey from inception to disruption in vivid style.</p><p>An extraordinary adventure that veers between outlandish caper and urgent cultural analysis. <i>Once Upon a Time in Shaolin</i> twists and turns through the mayhem and the mischief, while asking profound questions about our relationship with art, music, technology, and ultimately ourselves.</p></p><p>CYRUS BOZORGMEHR was the senior adviser on the <i>Once Upon a Time in Shaolin</i> project and worked alongside Wu-Tang Clan's RZA and producer Cilvaringz.

She broke through barriers for women in architecture and spent 15 years working for Chicago architect Frank Lloyd Wright, in the formative years of the Prairie School of Architecture. Then she teamed up with Walter Burley Griffin working with him in winning the design contest for the new Australian capital city, Canberra. She was an architect, artist, environmentalist, social observer and community builder, yet her work has been constantly overshadowed by the famous men in her life. The first biography of Marion Mahony Griffin in her own right, Making Magic tells Marion&#39;s story. It dates back to the days of Abraham Lincoln who was friends with her grandparents as a travelling lawyer in Illinois. It follows the story of her life over three continents - America, Australia and India. And her love affair with her husband which produced such historic results. A woman with a fierce sense of idealism and a passion for nature, Marion always had a mind of her own. She developed fine artistic and architectural skills which helped to make Wright and then Griffin famous. A woman in a man&#39;s world, she made history with her pioneering role as a female architect. Her creative work was sheer magic. Faced with her own challenges, she drew on her energy and creativity to refashion her role in a new country. She was instrumental in setting up a unique community in the Sydney suburb of Castlecrag. Her paintings, drawings and descriptions of the Australian bushland produced another exercise in magic. Yet few know her real story. Making Magic comes as Marion&#39;s role is now being recognised with accolades in America and Australia. Northwestern University Professor David Van Zanten describes her as the Frida Kahlo of the Chicago school of architecture. &#34;Everywhere and nowhere, forgotten then suddenly remembered, unique in her work.&#34; Drawing on her diaries and historical records in libraries in Australia and America, and conversations with Griffin experts home owners and others with links to Marion&#39;s life, Making Magic tells the story of a most unusual woman. It puts the case for her recognition as an important figure who emerged from Chicago&#39;s Prairie School of architecture and tells an inspiring story of a woman and her own special brand of magic.

Drawing on many personal accounts, Emmy Werner tells the story of the rescue of the Danish Jews from the vantage-point of living eyewitnesses- the last survivors of an extraordinary conspiracy of decency that triumphed in the midst of the horrors of the Holocaust. <i>A Conspiracy of Decency</i> chronicles the acts of people of good will from several nationalities. Among them were the German Georg F. Duckwitz, who warned the Jews of their impending deportation, the Danes who hid them and ferried them across the Oresund, and the Swedes who gave them asylum. Regardless of their social class, education, and religious and political persuasion, the rescuers all shared one important characteristic: they defined their humanity by their ability to act with great compassion. These people never considered themselves heroes &#x2013; they simply felt that they were doing the right thing.</p><p><b>Emmy E. Werner</b> is a developmental psychologist and research professor at the University of California at Davis. She is the author of many books, including <i>Through the Eyes of Innocents</i> (Westview Press 2000); <i>Reluctant Witnesses</i> (Westview Press, 1998); <i>Pioneer Children on the Journey West</i> (Westview Press 1995).Although it doesn't bring previously undisclosed events to light, this history of the Holocaust in Denmark offers a wealth of first-person material, placed within a factually accurate, well-crafted text. The Danes gave a famously cold shoulder to the Germans when they invaded in 1940, and secretly evacuated 7,000 Danish Jews to Sweden when the Germans ordered them deported in 1943. Werner (Reluctant Witnesses), a developmental psychologist and research professor at University of California, Davis, uses accessible concepts (such as people of "good will") to convey what happened, and gives careful accounts of the roles of the Danish Lutheran church, the universities and the large Copenhagen hospital Bispejberg in speaking out against deportation, and mobilizing when it was imminent. Werner devotes a chapter to the refugees' actual passage northward, and a chapter to their reception in Sweden, where some found employment. More than 450 Jews were captured by the Germans and sent to Theresienstadt (the so-called "show place" concentration camp in Czechoslovakia); they were exempted from extermination as a result of tireless Danish lobbying. Werner includes their experiences, as well as those of Jews hidden in Denmark, and of members of the Danish resistance. She concludes by surveying various studies of rescuers and bystanders during the Holocaust, attempting to distill motivations for action or inaction. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Broken Kind of Beautiful: A Novel</h2><p><b>Sometimes everything you ever learned about yourself is wrong</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>Fashion is a fickle industry, a frightening fact for twenty-four year old model Ivy Clark.

All grown up.<br><br>A distant rumble of thunder rolled across the blackened sky, leftover remnants from a tropical storm. A raindrop brushed his ear; another grazed the tip of his nose. Pastor Voss bowed his head. So did everyone else, including Ivy. A slight breeze ruffled wisps of hair around her downturned face and fluttered the butterfly sleeves of her dress. The last time he&#x2019;d seen her in the flesh, he had just returned to Greenbrier for a short summer stint after completing his freshman year at NYU. Ivy had been twelve going on fifty.

Ivy stared back, a smirk on her face.<br><br>&#x201c;Now&#x2019;s not the time to talk about this, Ivy.&#x201d; Bruce strode through the long grass toward a line of cars parked along the brick path, texting a message into his phone.<br><br>The drops of rain turned into a mist that settled over Ivy&#x2019;s arms, cooling her skin. If only the drizzle could quench her fear. Who was he texting? She lengthened her stride, trailing him like a long evening shadow. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one doing business.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do you know it&#x2019;s business?&#x201d; He dug into his pocket, pulled out his keys, and clicked the button on the remote to unlock the car doors. Two short beeps interrupted a chorus of chirping birds hiding somewhere in the Spanish moss that dripped from gnarled tree limbs overhead.<br><br>Ivy rolled her eyes. Only Bruce would lock his car inside a cemetery in Greenbrier, South Carolina. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t New York City.&#x201d; The two places existed on opposite poles. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think any burglars are prowling around waiting to break into your car.&#x201d;<br><br>He stopped in front of the black Lexus with rental plates.<br><br>She stopped too. &#x201c;I need to know, Bruce. It&#x2019;s my future we&#x2019;re talking about here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you were so concerned, you should have kept your mouth shut.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I made one lousy suggestion. You&#x2019;re telling me O&#x2019;Banion&#x2019;s getting bent out of shape because of one small&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not your job to make suggestions, especially not to a photographer like Miles O&#x2019;Banion.&#x201d;<br><br>Ivy&#x2019;s stomach knotted. What would happen if that one slip cost her two years of security? Her twenty-fifth birthday crept closer each day. As hard as she tried, she wasn&#x2019;t getting any younger and people were starting to notice. If she wanted to continue modeling, she needed that contract. Bruce ran his hand down his face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your job to keep your mouth closed and work for the camera. That&#x2019;s what you get paid for. Nobody cares about your opinions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;ve been told.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then why didn&#x2019;t you listen?&#x201d;<br><br>A small group of women dressed in black stopped conversing. Bruce painted on a smile and gave them a polite wave. He leaned close to Ivy and spoke from the corner of his mouth, his smile unwavering. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not talking about this here. Let&#x2019;s show a little respect.&#x201d;<br><br>Her muscles coiled. Respect? James didn&#x2019;t deserve her respect. She didn&#x2019;t care how touching the eulogy, how beautiful the flowers, or how crowded the funeral. Why should she care about losing a man who never wanted her in the first place? Why should his unspoken I love you echo in her mind? She refused to pretend her father&#x2019;s death had any bearing on her life. Because it didn&#x2019;t. She wouldn&#x2019;t let it. She gathered her mounting anger and stuffed it in the empty place inside her chest.<br><br>Bruce opened the passenger-side door. &#x201c;Get in the car.&#x201d;<br><br>She folded her arms. &#x201c;If you know something, as my agent, you have no right to keep it from me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anything. And when I find out, we can discuss it back in New York.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why did Annalise tell me I lost the contract?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because Annalise feeds off gossip, or haven&#x2019;t you figured that out yet?&#x201d;<br><br>Despite the stagnant heat, a chill crept across Ivy&#x2019;s skin. As her friend, Annalise wouldn&#x2019;t have pulled this out of thin air. It had to have some substance. She gripped her elbows, as if the harder her fingers dug into flesh, the less any of this would matter. &#x201c;Gossip always starts with a seed of truth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Look, either get in the car or I&#x2019;m leaving you here. Your choice.&#x201d;<br><br>Ivy looked over her shoulder at the rows of polished tombstones. Her throat tightened. She hugged her arms and stepped closer to the car. &#x201c;I want to go to the airport.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to the luncheon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was my brother and your father. We&#x2019;re not leaving now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was hardly my father.&#x201d; The emptiness expanded, carving her out like a pumpkin-turned-jack-o-lantern. She was nothing but a shell. A beautiful, empty shell.<br><br>An SUV pulled out from behind them. An engine rumbled in front. Except for a few stragglers in the distance lingering over her father&#x2019;s grave, the cemetery cleared.<br><br>Bruce drummed his fingers on the top of the car.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to sit in that house, eat cucumber sandwiches, and pretend to care that he&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have a choice.&#x201d; Bruce opened the door wider.<br><br>Her shoulders sagged. Ivy slid into the passenger side, pulled the seat belt across her body, snapped it into place, and stared straight ahead. Why had she said anything to O&#x2019;Banion? So what if he wanted to keep her in the same overdone pose? She shouldn&#x2019;t have said a word. If there was one mistake to avoid in her world, it was wounding the pride of a notoriously prideful photographer.<br><br>Bruce&#x2019;s door opened. He got inside and set his phone in the cup holder. As soon as he started the ignition, the phone vibrated, rattling loose change in the console. He swept up the device and held it against his ear. &#x201c;Bruce Olsen.&#x201d;<br><br>Nothing but the unintelligible chatter of a female voice from the other end.<br><br>A muscle pulsed in Bruce&#x2019;s jaw. He scratched his chin and looked out the window, hiding his expression. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back tomorrow. Could we meet then and talk this over?&#x201d; He clicked his seat belt into place and nodded. Another long pause. More unintelligible chatter. A sigh from her uncle. &#x201c;I understand. Thanks for getting back to me.&#x201d;<br><br>He hit the End button and started the car.<br><br>Ivy pressed her fingers against her sweat-dampened palms.<br><br>Bruce pulled out onto the brick street and steered toward the iron gate. &#x201c;It seems Ms. Reynolds wants a fresh face for her cosmetic line.&#x201d; He flipped on the radio. Bon Jovi&#x2019;s &#x201c;You Give Love a Bad Name&#x201d; blasted Ivy&#x2019;s ears. &#x201c;Sorry, kid. They&#x2019;re not renewing your contract.&#x201d;</p><h2>Dialect Diversity in America: The Politics of Language Change (Page-Barbour Lectures)</h2><p><p></p><p>The sociolinguist William Labov has worked for decades on change in progress in American dialects and on African American Vernacular English (AAVE). In <i>Dialect Diversity in America, </i>Labov examines the diversity among American dialects and presents the counterintuitive finding that geographically localized dialects of North American English are increasingly diverging from one another over time. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Contrary to the general expectation that mass culture would diminish regional differences, the dialects of Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, Birmingham, Buffalo, Philadelphia, and New York are now more different from each other than they were a hundred years ago. Equally significant is Labov's finding that AAVE does not map with the geography and timing of changes in other dialects. The home dialect of most African American speakers has developed a grammar that is more and more different from that of the white mainstream dialects in the major cities studied and yet highly homogeneous throughout the United States.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Labov describes the political forces that drive these ongoing changes, as well as the political consequences in public debate. The author also considers the recent geographical reversal of political parties in the Blue States and the Red States and the parallels between dialect differences and the results of recent presidential elections. Finally, in attempting to account for the history and geography of linguistic change among whites, Labov highlights fascinating correlations between patterns of linguistic divergence and the politics of race and slavery, going back to the antebellum United States. Complemented by an online collection of audio files that illustrate key dialectical nuances, <i>Dialect Diversity in America</i> offers an unparalleled sociolinguistic study from a preeminent scholar in the field.</p><p></p></p><p><p>William Labov, Fassit Professor of Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania, is author or coauthor of numerous works on linguistics, including <i>Principles of Linguistic Change,</i> volumes 1&#x2013;3, and <i>The Atlas of North American English: Phonetics, Phonology, and Sound Change.</i></p><p>In this compelling study William Labov confirms his reputation as a brilliant and pathbreaking analyst of linguistic change. Particularly arresting is his approach to the Northern Cities Shift, which he relates to the settlement of upstate New York and the Great Lakes area, where socially activist Yankees established a persisting cultural pattern that has shaped the processes of dialect divergence. Linguists and historians alike will find here much to admire and ponder.</p> (Richard Carwardine, President, Corpus Christi College, University of Oxford)<br><br><p>Labov demonstrates that he is not simply the leading sociolinguist of the past century, but that his research is relevant to the American public. He challenges one of the most cherished, commonsense assumptions about the English language&#x2015;that American dialects are becoming more homogenized&#x2015;by demonstrating how linguistic and social factors have conspired to make regional and ethnic dialects in the United States more divergent than ever. An amazing, powerful message!</p> (Walt Wolfram, North Carolina Language and Life Project, North Carolina State University)<br><br><p>In 1972, three linguists, led by William Labov of the University of Pennsylvania, christened the phenomenon... the Northern Cities Shift (NCS). What they observed may be the most important change in English pronunciation in centuries.</p> (<i>Slate</i>)<br><br><p>A clear-eyed overview of recent language changes in the United States and their connection to regional and national politics.</p> (<i>Shelf Awareness</i>)<br><br><p>In this well-written volume, the author draws on years of linguistic studies to demonstrate how and why the speech of Americans is diverging so sharply and how that is changing perceptions of dialect speakers....

This collection presents a radically different account, describing photography as a globally disseminated and locally appropriated medium. Essays firmly grounded in photographic practice&#x2014;in the actual making of pictures&#x2014;suggest the extraordinary diversity of nonwestern photography.<p></p><p>Richly illustrated with over 100 images, <i>Photography&#x2019;s Other Histories</i> explores from a variety of regional, cultural, and historical perspectives the role of photography in raising historical consciousness. It includes two first-person pieces by indigenous Australians and one by a Seminole/Muskogee/Dine' artist. Some of the essays analyze representations of colonial subjects&#x2014;from the limited ways Westerners have depicted Navajos to Japanese photos recording the occupation of Manchuria to the changing "contract" between Aboriginal subjects and photographers. Other essays highlight the visionary quality of much popular photography. Case studies centered in early-twentieth-century Peru and contemporary India, Kenya, and Nigeria chronicle the diverse practices that have flourished in postcolonial societies. <i>Photography&#x2019;s Other Histories</i> recasts popular photography around the world, as not simply reproducing culture but creating it.<br><i><br>Contributors. </i>Michael Aird, Heike Behrend, Jo-Anne Driessens, James Faris, Morris Low, Nicolas Peterson, Christopher Pinney, Roslyn Poignant, Deborah Poole, Stephen Sprague, Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie, Christopher Wright</p></p><p>&#34;&#34;Photography&#39;s Other Histories&#34; is a quite remarkable collection of essays on widely ranging photographic practices around the world.

They pride themselves on being selflessly committed to the highest ideals and seem particularly confident of the purity of their motives and the evil nature of their opponents. To correct economic and social injustice, liberals support a whole litany of policies and principles: progressive taxes, affirmative action, greater regulation of corporations, raising the inheritance tax, strict environmental regulations, children&#x2019;s rights, consumer rights, and much, much more. <br><br>But do they actually live by these beliefs? Peter Schweizer decided to investigate in depth the private lives of some prominent liberals: politicians like the Clintons, Nancy Pelosi, the Kennedys, and Ralph Nader; commentators like Michael Moore, Al Franken, Noam Chomsky, and Cornel West; entertainers and philanthropists like Barbra Streisand and George Soros. Using everything from real estate transactions, IRS records, court depositions, and their own public statements, he sought to examine whether they really live by the principles they so confidently advocate. <br><br>What he found was a long list of glaring contradictions. Michael Moore denounces oil and defense contractors as war profiteers. He also claims to have no stock portfolio, yet he owns shares in Halliburton, Boeing, and Honeywell and does his postproduction film work in Canada to avoid paying union wages in the United States. Noam Chomsky opposes the very concept of private property and calls the Pentagon &#x201c;the worst institution in human history,&#x201d; yet he and his wife have made millions of dollars in contract work for the Department of Defense and own two luxurious homes. Barbra Streisand prides herself as an environmental activist, yet she owns shares in a notorious strip-mining company. Hillary Clinton supports the right of thirteen-year-old girls to have abortions without parental consent, yet she forbade thirteen-year-old Chelsea to pierce her ears and enrolled her in a school that would not distribute condoms to minors. Nancy Pelosi received the 2002 Cesar Chavez Award from the United Farm Workers, yet she and her husband own a Napa Valley vineyard that uses nonunion labor.<br><br>Schweizer&#x2019;s conclusion is simple: liberalism in the end forces its adherents to become hypocrites. They adopt one pose in public, but when it comes to what matters most in their own lives&#x2014;their property, their privacy, and their children&#x2014;they jettison their liberal principles and embrace conservative ones. Schweizer thus exposes the contradiction at the core of liberalism: if these ideas don&#x2019;t work for the very individuals who promote them, how can they work for the rest of us?</p><p>The American Left prides itself on a selfless commitment to economic and social justice. With moral certitude, confident of the purity of their motives and the evil nature of their opponents, they support a familiar litany of causes and programs: progressive taxes, affirmative action, greater regulation of corporations, increasing the inheritance tax, stricter environmental safeguards, consumer rights, and more. <br>But do liberals actually practice what they preach? Peter Schweizer dug deep into the tax returns, real estate documents, business and investment patterns, court depositions, and hiring practices of Michael Moore, Al Franken, Noam Chomsky, the Clintons, Nancy Pelosi, the Kennedys, Ralph Nader, Cornel West, George Soros and Barbra Streisand. All are adept at avoiding taxes, invest in the very industries they denounce, and abandon environmental causes when they impinge on their own property rights. While they cry racism and support affirmative action, they have abysmal records when it comes to hiring minorities. They condemn abstinence-based sex ed programs, but enroll their own children in such programs. <br>Schweizer makes it clear that when it comes to what matters most in their lives--the protection of their property, privacy, and families--even the most outspoken liberals jettison their progressive ideas and adopt conservative principles. In short, liberalism forces its adherents to become hypocrites. Schweizer's conclusion is strikingly simple and highly persuasive: liberal principles that don't work for individuals have no place in shaping national programs and policies.PETER SCHWEIZER is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author of several books, including <i>Reagan&#x2019;s War</i> and <i>The Bushes</i>.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created a unique literary character who has remained popular for over a century and is appreciated more than ever today. But what made this fictional character, dreamed up by a small-town British doctor in the 1880s, into such a lasting success, despite the author&#x2019;s own attempt to escape his invention?<br><br>In <i>From Holmes to Sherlock</i>, Swedish author and Sherlock Holmes expert Mattias Bostr�m recreates the full story behind the legend for the first time. From a young Arthur Conan Doyle sitting in a Scottish lecture hall taking notes on his medical professor&#x2019;s powers of observation to the pair of modern-day fans who brainstormed the idea behind the TV sensation <i>Sherlock</i>, from the publishing world&#x2019;s first literary agent to the Georgian princess who showed up at the Conan Doyle estate and altered a legacy, the narrative follows the men and women who have created and perpetuated the myth. It includes tales of unexpected fortune, accidental romance, and inheritances gone awry, and tells of the actors, writers, readers, and other players who have transformed Sherlock Holmes from the gentleman amateur of the Victorian era to the odd genius of today. Told in fast-paced, novelistic prose, <i>From Holmes to Sherlock</i> is a singular celebration of the most famous detective in the world a must-read for newcomers and experts alike. </p></p><p><b>Mattias Bostr�m</b>, born in 1971, is a Swedish author, publisher, and Sherlock Holmes expert. He has written three books about Swedish popular culture history and has been an active Sherlockian for almost thirty years, publishing articles and editing books and booklets on the subject. He lives outside Stockholm with his wife and two young daughters.12 Tennison Road was a veritable writing factory. A relentless tapping could be heard through the open window. His twenty-three-year-old sister Connie had moved in with the family, and was certainly earning her keep. His plan was that his sister Lottie should also move down, that he could dictate to her while Connie typed away. That way, Conan Doyle would be able to double his productivity while resting both his hands and his eyes. Many of his author friends had worn themselves out and been struck with writers&#x2019; cramp of the hands.<p><br>Conan Doyle was busy planning the final Holmes stories when he received a letter from his mother. She was furious. He was not to kill off Sherlock Holmes under any circumstances. Instead, she provided him with the bones of another Holmes story for him to write, about a woman with a rather particular hair colour.</p><p> <br>His mother&#x2019;s words won the day. He was even able to use the idea, which became the twelfth, concluding story, &#x2018;The Copper Beeches&#x2019;. He finished writing it over Christmas 1891.</p><p><br>While the detective may have escaped with his life intact, as far as Conan Doyle was concerned, this was farewell to Sherlock Holmes.</p></p><h2>Rivers Of London Vol. 4: Detective Stories (Graphic Novel)</h2><p>CSI meets Harry Potter in this fantastic new graphic novel from Ben Aaronovitch, writer of the bestselling Rivers of London supernatural police procedural crime novel series!<br>An anthology series of stories featuring Police Constable Peter Grant, his partner, Sahra Guleed, and their associates, as they tackle supernatural crime on the streets of London!<br>An all-new adventure for Ben Aaronvitch's laconic, way-past-cool but slightly geeky trainee wizard and budding detective, Peter Grant!<br><br>Tying directly into the Rivers of London continuity.<br><br>Aaronovitch is joined by Doctor Who writer Andrew Cartmel for this gripping new series.</p><p>Ben Aaronovitch has written for TV, his credits including Doctor Who and Casualty; his Rivers of London novels are international bestsellers and he has finally fulfilled his dream of adding a comic to the series; in this he has been joined by fellow writer and regular Doctor Who contributor Andrew Cartmel.

Eliot</i></b></p><p>This two-volume critical edition of T. S. Eliot&#x2019;s poems establishes a new text of the <i>Collected Poems 1909&#x2013;1962</i>, rectifying accidental omissions and errors that have crept in during the century since Eliot&#x2019;s astonishing debut, &#x201c;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.&#x201d; In addition to the masterpieces, <i>The Poems of T. S. Eliot</i> contains the poems of Eliot&#x2019;s youth, which were rediscovered only decades later; poems that circulated privately during his lifetime; and love poems from his final years, written for his wife, Valerie. Calling upon Eliot&#x2019;s critical writings as well as his drafts, letters, and other original materials, Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue have provided a commentary that illuminates the imaginative life of each poem.</p><p>Following the collected and uncollected poems of the first volume, this second volume opens with the two books of verse of other kinds that Eliot issued: the children&#x2019;s verse of <i>Old Possum&#x2019;s Book of Practical Cats</i>, and <i>Anabasis</i>, his translation of St.-John Perse&#x2019;s <i>Anabase</i>. This volume then gathers the verses that Eliot contributed to the learnedly lighthearted exchanges of <i>Noctes Binanian�</i>, and others that he wrote off-the-cuff or for intimate friends. Each of these sections is accompanied by its own commentary. Finally, pertaining to the entire edition, there is a comprehensive textual history that contains not only variants from all known drafts and the many printings but also extended passages amounting to hundreds of lines of compelling verse.</p></p><p><p><b>Thomas Stearns Eliot</b> was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1888.

The author provides a detailed analysis of the letters of Paul (including those whose authorship is questioned) individually, exploring the Christology of each one, and then attempts a synthesis of the exegetical work into a biblical Christology of Paul.<br><br>The author's synthesis covers the following themes: Christ's roles as divine Savior and as preexistent and incarnate Savior; Jesus as the Second Adam, the Jewish Messiah, and Son of God; and as the Messiah and exalted Lord. Fee also explores the relationship between Christ and the Spirit and considers the Person and role of the Spirit in Paul's thought. Appendices cover the theme of Christ and Personified Wisdom, and Paul's use of <i>Kurios</i> (Lord) in citations and echoes of the Septuagint.<br><br>"Anyone who has read even a smattering of Paul's writings recognizes early on that his devotion to Christ was the foremost reality and passion of his life. What he said in one of his later letters serves as a kind of motto for his entire Christian life: 'For me to live is Christ; to die is [to] gain [Christ]' (Phil. 1:21). Christ is the beginning and goal of everything for Paul, and thus is the single great reality along the way."--From the Introduction</p><p>"A remarkably comprehensive and detailed account of Pauline Christology. Fee draws on his close lifetime study of the material to present a clear and gripping account of Paul's high Christology in constant reasoned debate with scholars who interpret the material in other ways. It will at once take its place as the major study of this crucial topic, and its innovative proposals regarding some of the texts will stimulate a lively ongoing debate."<br>--<b>I. Howard Marshall</b>, University of Aberdeen<br><br>"Thoroughly researched, comprehensive, and wide-ranging, this solid study is arranged in such a way that it is useful not only for its total impact, pointing as it does to the coherence of Paul's christological thought, but also for its careful exegetical studies of individual passages. Use of this clearly written and persuasively argued study will put the reader deeply in Fee's debt. It is a volume to be highly recommended."<br>--<b>Paul J. Achtemeier</b>, author of <i>Inspiration and Authority: Nature and Function of Christian Scripture<br></i><br>"[Fee] brings his great erudition and theological insight to bear on the topic of Paul's christology, which strangely, as Fee points out, has not been the subject of many explicit book-length studies. This work, encyclopedic in its length and format, goes a long way toward making up for such neglect. . . . There is no doubt that this substantial study will be a reference point for some time to come."<br>--<b>Donald Senior, CP</b>, <i>The Bible Today<br></i><br>"<i>Pauline Christology</i> is Fee at his best. His exegetical work is fresh, engaging, and independent. He is not afraid to challenge some current academic 'assured results,' and whether one finally agrees with him or not, his arguments need to be seriously considered. The book is fundamentally important not only for both Pauline and NT theology but also for countless specific exegetical analyses."<br>--<b>Douglas J. Moo</b>, Wheaton College Graduate School<br><br>"To say that this work is monumental is to understate the case. . . . [Fee] helpfully walks the reader through his exegetical decisions one text at a time and provides a synthesis that gathers all the relevant data under consideration, making this a goldmine of a reference book. Any future work on Paul's Christology or christological studies in general will be forced to reckon with this magnificent volume for years to come."<br>--<b>Matthew D.

My father wore a moth-eaten dinner jacket and poured champagne while Mama offered marijuana cigarettes to the ne'er do wells of Philadelphia high society who'd come to see how far the mighty had fallen. </p><p> At the party's climax, my parents shot off fireworks and presented the Blackbird family art collection to my sister Emma. The Blackbird furniture went to my sister Libby. </p><p> Perhaps under the impression that I was the most responsible member of the family--which only means I'm the one who never entered a wet T-shirt contest-Mama and Daddy gave me the Bucks County farm. Then they blew the country for a sunny resort that catered to American tax evaders, leaving stardust in their wake and me with a delinquent property tax bill for two million dollars. </p><p> That winter I gave up my Rittenhouse Square condo and moved back to the decaying splendor of our family homestead. I sold my symphony subscription seats, got a partial refund on a weekend trip to Paris and terminated my charge account at Neiman Marcus, which was probably good for my soul anyway. </p><p> I tried to get used to poverty. I really did. But by spring I was down to my last Lean Cuisine, and the tax man had my number on his speed dial. </p><p> Which is why I, Nora Blackbird, former socialite who never really held a job in all my thirty-one years unless you count being secretary of the Junior League, found myself in dire need of a paycheck. </p><p> "How's the job hunt?" my sister Emma asked me over our monthly lunch at the Rusty Sabre, the white tablecloth inn in New Hope. She lit up a cigarette after she'd been served her spinach salad and sat back to consider her next move on the food. "Find anybody who wants to hire an expert at organizing charity balls?" </p><p> "I do have other skills, you know." </p><p> "You're really good at seating charts," said our older sister Libby, buttering a roll and showing none of Emma's reluctance to chow down. Libby wore her excess pounds to sexy perfection. "A successful seating chart is a work of art. In fact, I'm hoping you'll help us with the wedding, Nora." </p><p> Her stepson was getting married soon. Half of Philadelphia knew the details thanks to frequent bulletins in the papers that documented the union of two old families---the Treese clan of Main Line and Libby's new in-laws, the Kintswells of Society Hill. </p><p> Bored with the endless wedding discussion, Emma ignored Libby's gambit to hash it over again. To me, she said, "Maybe the White House needs someone new." </p><p> Libby stopped buttering and said quite seriously, "That's not a bad idea." </p><p> Emma winked at me. "You do beautiful calligraphy." </p><p> "And I can polish silver." </p><p> "But seating charts are your gift, really," Libby said. </p><p> Emma and I exchanged grins. </p><p> The three of us began having our sisterly lunches about eighteen months ago, shortly after Emma and I lost our husbands. Libby had been a widow for several years and remarried, but when Emma's husband Jake died in a car crash that nearly killed her, too, and a few weeks later my Todd was shot in a South Philly parking lot, Libby assembled the sisterhood. We took turns being the designated basket case, and to our collective surprise, our lunches were therapeutic. For the first time since our teenaged years, we were close again. We shared our frustration with Mama and Daddy, argued over how best to cope with being poor-Libby, the oldest and most free-spirited, advocated complete denial and Emma, the youngest and wired tighter than a piano string, never spent a nickel anyway--and we howled over the things that only sisters can find hilarious, like Aunt Rosemary's shoplifting tendencies and our family inability to cook a decent meal. </p><p> We were not without conflict, of course. </p><p> Libby had appeared for our May lunch wearing one of her long, engulfing artistic dresses with a plunging neckline. Normally, she sported a beflowered straw hat as if ready to fly to Ascot at a moment's notice. But today her hair was loose and Bardot feminine. Hardly any splotches of paint marred her manicure. All of her outfits included matching canvas bags in which she carried an ever-changing collection of books to share with anyone who came along. Libby had grown up ahead of Emma and me, during the time when our parents lived like minor royalty, so she had a different approach to life. Lady Bountiful in Birkenstocks, often lugging a sketchbook to document important moments in her life. She was an Artist of Life, she claimed. Things like financial survival were irrelevant to her. </p><p> Libby shook her knife and said, "No, they already have somebody at the White House. Remember Divvy Moncreath? Her son works there now. He gets along beautifully with the First Lady. They have the same taste in china." </p><p> "Divvy Moncreath," I said, "is probably the only woman in America who made a campaign contribution so her son could fold napkins." </p><p> "He's brilliant with place settings." </p><p> "How do you know that?" Emma asked Libby. She was dressed in riding breeches and boots, as always, and she didn't give a damn that the other ladies lunching nearby cast cool glances at the mud she'd tracked in. </p><p> Of the three of us, Emma was the stone fox. A chic, very short and asymmetrical haircut flattered the narrow shape of her head, her sharp-cut cheekbones and wide-set bedroom eyes. The Blackbird auburn hair and magnolia white skin that made me look like a Victorian bride with the vapors, was sexy as hell on Emma. Her riding breeches fit her like a pair of gloves, and her boots gave my younger sister a piratical air that suited the look in her eye. Two inches taller than me and with ten pounds strategically rearranged, she could have gotten work as an exotic dancer anywhere. </p><p> Em always looked as if she's just rolled out of somebody's bed . . . with a whip. Libby looked ready to slide <i>into</i> the next convenient four-poster. And I-well, I wasn't going to venture under anyone's down comforter but my own for a long time. My husband's death had blindsided me, but didn't compare to the hell of our last two years together when Todd binged on cocaine, lost his medical research job and showed me what havoc one man's weakness could inflict on the union of two people who loved each other passionately. No, men were too much trouble. </p><p> "I already got a job," I announced, intervening before the sisterly sniping developed into a full-blown squabble. "I started last week, so the White House will have to muddle through without me." </p><p> "What job?" Libby brightened. "Where?" </p><p> "I went to see Rory Pendergast." I smiled at the memory of dear old "uncle" Rory, years ago our grandfather Blackbird's tennis partner, coming to my rescue. "I asked him for a job and he invited me to write for his newspaper." </p><p> "Nora, that's fabulous!" </p><p> "He still owns that rag?" Emma blew smoke. "I guess every billionaire industrialist needs a hobby in his declining years." </p><p> "How is sweet Rory?" Libby asked. "I haven't seen him in weeks. I should call him, in fact. We have things to discuss." </p><p> "This is about Nora," Emma said. "So shut up and listen." </p><p> "Rory looked great," I went on steadily. "A little frail, maybe, but still naughty. He's eighty-five if he's a day." </p><p> Libby lifted her wineglass in a toast. "And he recognizes talent when he sees it. Writing all those medical articles for your husband has come in handy, Nora. Kudos! Tell us what you'll be doing for the <i>Intelligencer</i>. A column for the health section?" </p><p> "No-" </p><p> "Medical tips?" </p><p> "No," I said, taking a deep breath. "I'm writing for the society page." </p><p> A short, stunned silence. Libby put down her glass. </p><p> Then Emma laughed outright. "Good God," she said. "You're going to write meaningful prose about debutante balls?" </p><p> "It's a steady job." </p><p> But a job that came with at least one drawback and Emma immediately hit the bullseye. </p><p> She said, "Tell me you're not working with Kitty Keough." </p><p> I gathered my courage and admitted, "I'm her assistant." </p><p> Libby clapped one hand to her mouth to stop a laugh. "You're kidding!" </p><p> For thirty years, Kitty Keough had been the elephant in the middle of every table at Philadelphia parties. She reported on weddings and funerals, cocktail receptions and tea parties. She detailed what people wore, ate and said. She had printed more pictures of men in tuxedos than People magazine ever will, picked her fork at more sea bass dinners with bulimic girls than a Miss America chaperone and air kissed more wealthy women than a presidential candidate. She wrote clever columns that sent the whole city flipping to The Back Page every Sunday to read how she cut the rich and famous down to size. </p><p> But she'd also made enemies along the way. </p><p> Emma said, "You're life's in danger the minute your name is associated with hers. People hate Kitty Keough's guts." </p><p> "Readers don't." </p><p> "But our friends do," said Libby. "And what she said about Daddy and Mama!" </p><p> "Every word was true," I pointed out. </p><p> "So what will you be doing exactly?" Emma asked. </p><p> "The job isn't much different than my life used to be," I explained. "I'm invited to the same cocktail parties, banquets and balls. Except afterwards I write up what I've seen and heard. I'll attend parties for a living." </p><p> "And Kitty?" Emma propped her elbows on the table, ready to dish. "I bet she was delighted to see you sashaying into her territory." </p><p> "She hasn't exactly rolled out the red carpet," I admitted. </p><p> "It's your name," Libby declared. "The Blackbirds are everything Kitty Keough is not. She's going to make your life miserable." </p><p> "And the fact that Rory hired you himself," Emma added with a grin. "That ticked her off big time, didn't it? She hates anybody being more connected than she is." </p><p> To be accepted in New York, goes the saying, all you need is money. Lots of money. But here in Philadelphia, it's who you are that counts. </p><p> The Blackbirds, a family as old as the city itself, counted. </p><p> Kitty Keough did not. </p><p> "She seems a little upset about our relationship with Rory," I agreed "She's sending me to some ... unusual places. Just to teach me the ropes, I'm sure." </p><p> "To teach you a lesson," Emma said. "She wants you under her thumb from the get-go." </p><p> "Maybe Rory is easing Kitty out." Libby dropped her voice to keep such speculation a secret from the women at the next table. "Maybe they're grooming you to take over. She's been writing the society column for a hundred years." </p><p> Emma nodded. "Rory's got you in the bull pen." </p><p> "She has no intention of leaving," I said quickly. "If she thought I was trying to replace her-" </p><p> "You'd be dead meat," Emma finished for me. </p><p> Kitty Keough's work seemed silly to people outside our world, yes, but if you wanted to raise a million dollars for cancer research by holding a black tie ball, you needed Kitty to sell tickets beforehand and pat the big donors on the back afterwards. If you wanted to heighten the public profile of your company, you sent Kitty an invitation to a party where you gave a dozen computers to an underprivileged youth club. You let her photograph your wife in a ball gown to get a mention for your law firm, investment bank or plastic surgery practice. You needed Kitty's help to build a hospital, save an old theater or feed the homeless. </p><p> But for a woman who pretended her father never worked in a steel mill, the climb onto the dais at the mayor's inaugural ball had been a long one. So Kitty relished every minute of fawning, every box of chocolates sent by handsome CEOs, every engraved invitation hand-delivered by a personal assistant of society leaders. She dressed like a movie star and splashed her weekly page of newsprint with wit and venom as well as the niceties. And readers ate it up. She used her column to slap down social climbers who didn't pay her proper deference. She complained when seated at a bad table or if paired with a dull dinner companion. Her paragraphs gushed with favorite names and high praise for anyone who played the game her way, but sharp put-downs became her best known comments. </p><p> "Lacey Chenoweth's garden looks a little less posh this year," Kitty wrote after one hostess failed to pay her respect. "Maybe the lovely Mrs. C. is letting her lace slip elsewhere this spring." </p><p> My sisters absorbed the fact that I now worked for the most feared woman in our social circle. </p><p> Emma said, "Well, don't drink from the office water cooler." </p><p> "And," added Libby, "don't get pushed down any elevator shafts." </p><p> "You're way off base," I said. "It's going to work out fine. My more pressing problem is the tax bill." </p><p> I sipped my wine and braced myself to deliver the news I'd really come to tell them.

"Not because Mama and Daddy didn't pay their taxes." </p><p> Both Libby and Emma looked at me with their full attention. </p><p> I gathered my courage and said, "This job will help me make payments on the tax bill, but first I have to reduce the debt.

The rise of conflicting political parties, which the founders opposed, and President John Adams&#x2019; Alien and Sedition Acts repressing First Amendment rights made Franklin&#x2019;s observation at the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention&#x2015;&#x201c;a republic, if you can keep it&#x201d;&#x2015;seem prescient.</p><p>In the twentieth century, America endured numerous struggles: economic depression, World War II, McCarthyism, the Vietnam War, Watergate, the Iran-contra scandal, the war in Iraq&#x2015;all of which gave rise to demagogues, as did the growth and reach of mass media. But this wasn&#x2019;t the Founding Fathers&#x2019; vision for our leadership. The resistance to putting a demagogue in the White House survived the anti-Communist agitation of the 1950s and the Vietnam War in the 1960s. But the latter opened the way for Richard Nixon&#x2019;s election in 1968 and Watergate, which again tested our democratic institutions and the rule of law. Nixon&#x2019;s resignation in August 1974 moved Vice President Gerald Ford, his successor, to declare, &#x201c;My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.&#x201d;</p><p>But was it? Donald Trump&#x2019;s 2016 election has presented a new challenge. How did past politics and presidential administrations pave the way for this current assault on American democracy? Our nation&#x2019;s history provides reassurance that we will restore our better angels to government. Yet it must be considered that earlier administrations and public outlook facilitated the rise of such an un-presidential character as Trump in the first place. In <em>American Politics and Presidents,</em> Robert Dallek considers a century of modern administrations, from Teddy Roosevelt to today, shining a light on the personalities behind the politics and the voters who elected each. His cautionary tale reminds us that the only constant in history is change, but whether for good or ill the choice is Americans&#x2019; to make.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Robert Dallek is the author of <em>An Unfinished Life: John F.

When a mysterious stranger comes walking into town seeking employment at the Cross-Triangle Ranch, life changes for these simple country folk. The stranger goes by the name Honorable Patches, and throughout the book, his tumultuous past and his intentions for coming out West are revealed. Patches is put to the test many times by the other employees including the caretaker, Phil Acton, and the owner, Dean Baldwin. As Patches continues to prove his worth, the ranch employees learn the importance of a natural life and its role in what it means to be a man. Harold Bell Wright (1872-1944) was a Disciples of Christ minister. He traveled extensively and wrote about the goodness of mankind. After authoring That Printer of Udell&#39;s-a book that inspired Ronald Reagan-he wrote The Shepherd of the Hills, which has sold more than one million copies. Wright&#39;s ongoing battle with tuberculosis led him to settle in Imperial Valley, California, where he wrote The Winning of Barbara Worth. The following books are published by Pelican as a set: A Harold Bell Wright Trilogy: The Shepherd of the Hills, The Calling of Dan Matthews, and God and the Groceryman.Although mostly forgotten or ignored after the middle of the 20th century, Wright is said to have been the first American writer to sell a million copies of a novel and the first to make $1 million from writing fiction.</p><h2>The Paris Secret: A Novel</h2><p><p>In this glittering tale of forgotten treasures and long-held secrets, international bestseller Karen Swan explores one woman&#x2019;s journey to discovering the truth behind an abandoned apartment and a family whose mysteries may be better left undiscovered.</p><p>When high-powered fine art agent Flora Sykes is called in to assess <em>objets d&#x2019;art</em> in a Paris apartment that has been abandoned since WWII, she is skeptical at first&#x2014;until she discovers that the treasure trove of paintings is myriad...and priceless.

In January 1947 Simone de Beauvoir landed at La Guardia airport and began a four-month journey that took her from one coast of the United States to the other, and back again. Embraced by the Cond� Nast set in a swirl of cocktail parties in New York, where she was hailed as the "prettiest existentialist" by Janet Flanner in <i>The New Yorker</i>, de Beauvoir traveled west by car, train, and Greyhound, immersing herself in the nation's culture, customs, people, and landscape. The detailed diary she kept of her trip became <i>America Day by Day,</i> published in France in 1948 and offered here in a completely new translation. It is one of the most intimate, warm, and compulsively readable texts from the great writer's pen.<br><br>Fascinating passages are devoted to Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, New Orleans, Las Vegas, and San Antonio. We see de Beauvoir gambling in a Reno casino, smoking her first marijuana cigarette in the Plaza Hotel, donning raingear to view Niagara Falls, lecturing at Vassar College, and learning firsthand about the Chicago underworld of morphine addicts and petty thieves with her lover Nelson Algren as her guide. This fresh, faithful translation superbly captures the essence of Simone de Beauvoir's distinctive voice. It demonstrates once again why she is one of the most profound, original, and influential writers and thinkers of the twentieth century.<br><br><b>On New York:</b>"I walk between the steep cliffs at the bottom of a canyon where no sun penetrates: it's permeated by a salt smell. Human history is not inscribed on these carefully calibrated buildings: They are closer to prehistoric caves than to the houses of Paris or Rome."<br><br><b>On Los Angeles:</b>"I watch the Mexican dances and eat chili con carne, which takes the roof off my mouth, I drink the tequila and I'm utterly dazed with pleasure."</p><p>"The author of this ravishing book is the novelist in Simone de Beauvoir at thirty-something. Her travel diary records--with fresh, hungry, sensuous curiosity--the cultural climate of postwar America just before the Cold War closed down. No writer could be better company in that complex, vanished world than Simone de Beauvoir."--Diane Middlebrook<p>"Simone de Beauvoir in NY in 1947: Like all Europeans she begins to lament the obvious--the hard edges, the crude self-involvement, the absence of cafe life--and then suddenly she gives herself up to the aloneness of the city with a responsiveness astonishing for the brilliance it generates. Fifty years later it is still exciting to be in her company as she discovers unexpected love for the capital of the new world."--Vivian Gornick</p><b>Simone de Beauvoir</b> (1908-1986) is the author of many books, among them <i>The Second Sex</i> (1949) and <i>The Mandarins</i> (1954), which won the Prix Goncourt. <b>Carol Cosman</b> is a freelance translator who has also translated Jean-Paul Sartre's <i>The Family Idiot: Gustave Flaubert, 1821-1857</i>. <b>Douglas Brinkley</b> is a Professor of History at the University of New Orleans and the author of a forthcoming biography of Jimmy Carter.</p><h2>Ride the Moon Down</h2><p><b>The time of the mountain man is coming to an end, but some&#x2014;like Titus Bass will not exit gently.

Havana is now flooded with dollars, populated by pimps, prostitutes, drug dealers, and other hunters of the night. In the book collection of a rich Cuban who fled after the fall of Batista, Conde discovers an article about Violeta del Rio, a beautiful bolero singer of the 1950s who disappeared mysteriously. A murder soon follows. This is a crime story set in today&#x2019;s darker Cuba, but it is also an evocation of the Havana of Batista, the city of a hundred night clubs where the paths of Marlon Brando and Meyer Lansky crossed.</p><p>Probably <b>Leonardo Padura</b>&#x2019;s best book, <i>Havana Fever</i> is many things: a suspenseful crime novel, a cruel family saga, and an ode to literature and his beloved, ravaged island.</p></p><p>Leonardo Padura was born in 1955 in Havana and lives in Cuba. He has published a number of novels, short story collections and literary essays but international fame came with the Havana Quartet, all featuring Inspector Mario Conde, of which Havana Blue is the third to be available in English Critically acclaimed translator known for extensive work on Juan Goytisolo.

Padura is most famous for his Inspector Mario Conde novels, all published in English by Bitter Lemon Press.<br><br>Starred Review. Part biblio-mystery, part tragedy and all brilliant, Padura's follow-up to his Havana Quartet (<i>Havana Gold</i>, etc.) finds Mario Conde 14 years after retiring from the police force pursuing books instead of criminals, acting as a book scout to earn enough for food and drink. His famed intuition leads him to a decrepit mansion, its old and odd inhabitants, and to the most impressive private library ever assembled in Cuba, untouched for 43 years. Stuck in between a book's pages, he discovers a 1960 magazine photo of a sultry singer, Violeta del R�o, who disappeared in the 1950s. Conde's curiosity turns to obsession as he tries to unravel Violeta's sad fate. The trail takes Conde into the past when Batista ruled, revolution was near and gangsters like Meyer Lansky oversaw casinos, clubs and brothels. It will also take him into the most dangerous and terrible of Havana's barrios. The glory of Cuba's biblio-history drives this exceptional novel. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In order to thrive, we need to nourish this bond. In <i>The Healing Code of Nature</i>, biologist Clemens G. Arvay illuminates the miraculous ways that the human body interprets the living "code" of plants, animals, and our larger natural habitat for healing and sustenance. Here is a book as inspiring as it is fascinating, offering a new vision for the future of medicine and the way we relate to our environment.</p><p> Learn more about:</p><p> � The new science of eco-psychosomatics: the study of the close connection between mind, body, and nature<br> � The biophilia effect and the healing relationship between humans and trees<br> � Epigenetics and the mounting evidence of how environmental experiences of a living being can directly affect genetic material<br> � The role of evolutionary medicine in understanding and treating cancer<br> � Regenerating in nature and taking a time-out from the stressors of modern living<br> � Unleashing the healing potential of encounters with animals<br> � Moving beyond the materialist view to reclaim nature as an unsolvable mystery</p></p><p><b>Clemens G. Arvay</b> is an Austrian biologist who studied landscape ecology at Graz University and applied plant sciences at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna. Arvay examines the relationship between humans and nature, focusing on the health-promoting effects of contact with plants, animals, and landscapes. The author also addresses a second range of topics that includes ecologically produced food along with the economics of large food conglomerates. Clemens G. Arvay has written numerous books including <i>The Biophilia Effect</i>. More at clemensarvay.com.<p>&#x201c;The biologist Clemens Arvay has given us a concise, utterly fascinating critique of the still-dominant reductionist, materialist view of the natural world. More important, he is one of the handful of modern eco-philosophers helping to paint a portrait of a future we can still help create, where human beings are not defined by the color of their skin or even the content of their brains, but by their integration with all of life.&#x201d; &#x2015;Richard Louv, author of The Nature Principle and Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder</p><p>&#x201c;The Healing Code of Nature is a science-based manifesto about the growing field of &#x2018;nature medicine&#x2019; that carefully outlines what human lives need as we move forward in a world in which all forms of nature are disappearing at unprecedented rates. Clemens Arvay writes convincingly and eloquently about how, when we get &#x2018;out into nature,&#x2019; we not only can sustain healthy bodies and minds, but also cure ourselves. He stresses that nature as a whole must be preserved not only for the benefits we reap when we get out and enjoy magnificent landscapes and fascinating nonhuman animals, but also to save natural diversity for future generations who may need getting outdoors more than we do now. The book shows that as we become aware of the benefits that accrue when we immerse ourselves in the great outdoors, it&#x2019;ll be a win-win for all animals human and nonhuman, as well as for diverse flora, living bodies of water, and inanimate entities. Written for a broad and global audience, I hope that Clemens Arvay&#x2019;s new book will be enjoyed by the masses and shared widely.&#x201d; &#x2015;Marc Bekoff, PhD, professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology, University of Colorado, Boulder; author of Rewilding Our Hearts: Building Pathways of Compassion and Coexistence and Canine Confidential: Why Dogs Do What They Do</p><p>&#x201c;In his deeply researched book, Clemens Arvay accumulates a host of empirical evidence that humans must not be understood as physically separated from non-human life. The message is profound: we cannot heal if we don&#x2019;t understand that nature&#x2019;s suffering is literally our own. Letting the web of life die means cutting the ties to our own immune system&#x2015;not in symbolic, but in a literal sense. Arvay&#x2019;s book is one of the pioneering works heralding a new, post-dualistic era of thinking, in which we understand ourselves as part of a vast commons of life.&#x201d; &#x2015;Andreas Weber, PhD, author of Matter &amp; Desire, Biology of Wonder, and Enlivenment</p></p><h2>The Tao of the Tao Te Ching (Suny Series in Chinese Philosophy &amp; Culture) (SUNY series in Chinese Philosophy and Culture)</h2><p>In this new translation and commentary, LaFargue interprets the concept of &#x201c;Tao&#x201d; in the Tao Te Ching as a spiritual state of mind cultivated in a particular school in ancient China&#x201a; a state of mind which also expressed itself in a simple but satisfying life-style, and in a low-key but effective style of political leadership. The interpretation offered here is not only historically accurate, but also conveys the spiritual depth of the Tao Te Ching and its contemporary relevance. The translation is made transparent by a design that presents all of the commentary on the page facing the relevant text.</p><p><p>Michael LaFargue is the author of Language and Gnosis and teaches at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.</p>&#x201c;This translation and commentary takes a novel, even controversial approach to the Tao Te Ching, presenting the reader with a full-blown culturological understanding of this core Taoist classic. In its resolute attention to the detail of historical context, it is engaging, plausible, and for those close to the text, importantly revealing. LaFargue, taking full advantage of recent archaeological finds to inform his reading, is very contemporary. Here at last we have a translation which combines philological responsibility with the imagination necessary to unfold this powerful text.&#x201d; &#x2015; Roger T. Ames, University of Hawaii<br><br>&#x201c;I want to urge straight away that this is one of the very best books I have ever read on Chinese philosophy and culture. LaFargue&#x2019;s book is the work of a refined, well-informed, sensible, straightforward, honest, candidly self-confident (yet somehow unassuming), imaginatively independent and, yes, wise individual who&#x2015;largely because these gifts are exploited by an extremely well-trained mind&#x2015;manages to say persistently fresh and evocative things about a much abused text and the vision it informs.<br><br>&#x201c;More than any other classical Chinese work, perhaps, the Tao Te Ching has been ripped from its historical, culture and concretely experiential context and employed (like a set of transcultural Rorschach images) to tickle the meditative fancies of Mystical Everyman. LaFargue&#x2019;s worry about the origin and evolution of the text, its intended audience and the &#x2018;purpose&#x2019; of its aphorisms allows him to ask relevant hermeneutical questions the response to which opens the text in a new way. In place of near-sighted readings of the Tao Te Ching which find it to be simply another comforting example of philosophia perennis, LaFargue&#x2019;s method is to dispense with the corrective lenses of philosophical semantics and to bring the text into focus by holding it at arms&#x2019; length. By thus distancing the text from its contemporary readers, LaFargue, paradoxically, makes possible a much more intimate relationship to the Tao Te Ching than has heretofore been possible to Western readers.&#x201d; &#x2015; David L. Hall, The University of Texas-El Paso</p><h2>Nourishing the Essence of Life: The Outer, Inner, and Secret Teachings of Taoism</h2><p>The teachings of Taoism, China's great wisdom tradition, apply to every aspect of life, from the physical to the spiritual&#x2014;and include instruction on everything from lifestyle (a life of simplicity and moderation is best) to the work of inner alchemy that is said to lead to longevity and immortality. <br><br>Here, Eva Wong presents and explains three classic texts on understanding the Tao in the macrocosm of the universe and the microcosm of the body that provide an excellent overview of the three traditional levels of the Taoist teachings&#x2014;Outer, Inner, and Secret. The Outer teachings are concerned with understanding the Tao as manifested in nature and society. They are easily accessible to the layperson and consist of the Taoist philosophy of nature and humanity, advice on daily living, and a brief introduction to the beginning stages of Taoist meditation. The Inner teachings familiarize the practitioner with the energetic structure of the human body and introduce methods of stilling the mind and cultivating internal energy for health and longevity. The Secret teachings describe the highest level of internal-alchemical transformations within the body and mind for attaining immortality.</p><p>Eva Wong is an independent scholar and a practitioner of the Taoist arts of the Pre-Celestial Way and Complete Reality lineages.

Retelling their stories with empathy and a trained literary eye, she shows how, despite the constraints of their culturally imposed roles, they acted as free and fully three-dimensional human beings. Sometimes, indeed, forced to choose priorities and to decide between competing values, they went directly against those cultural constraints to make courageous decisions decisions that powerfully affected not only the narrative of the Bible but, in pivotal ways, the general history of humankind. Most notably, through their choices, these women became ancestors of Christ or, in one case, his close and supportive associate and the first witness to his resurrection. These are fascinating stories, worthy of our reflection. In Matriarchs of the Messiah, Jo Ann Skousen has given them some of the attention they deserve. --Daniel Peterson, Professor of Islamic Studies and Arabic, Brigham Young University; author, Abraham Divided and others</p><h2>Jesus Daily: 365 Interactive Devotions</h2><p>Based on the major themes found on the most active Facebook page in history, JESUS DAILY is a 365-day interactive devotional that goes beyond even the fan page to create a deeper experience and cultural movement that celebrates your redemption in Christ.

These brave women, the first ever to fly in combat, proved that women could be among the best of warriors, withstanding the rigors of combat and downing the enemy. <br><br>The women who tell their stories here began the war mostly as inexperienced girls&#x2014;many of them teenagers. In support of their homeland, they volunteered to serve as bomber and fighter pilots, navigator-bombardiers, gunners, and support crews. Flying against the Luftwaffe, they saw many of their friends&#x2014;as well as many of their foes&#x2014;fall to earth in flames. Their three combat Air Force regiments fought as many as one thousand missions during the war.<br><br>For their heroism and success against the enemy, two of the women's regiments were honored by designation as "Guard" regiments. At least thirty women were decorated with the gold star of Hero of the Soviet Union, their nation's highest award.<br><br>But equally courageous were the women's efforts to show the Red Army that they were entirely adequate to the great role they sought. For even though Stalin had decreed equality for both sexes, the women had to grapple initially with deep distrust from male pilots and Red Army officers, against whom they eventually prevailed.<br><br>War, Stalin-era politics, and human emotion mix in these gripping, first-person accounts. Supported by photographs of the women at war, the stories are unforgettable. Portraits of the women as they are now, taken by award-winning photographer Anne Noggle, add the perspective of time to the experiences of the survivors of this great dance with death.</p><p>Anne Noggle, herself an American Woman Airforce Service Pilot in World War II, has made lengthy visits to Moscow to conduct more than seventy interviews and to photograph the Soviet airwomen. Noggle is a captain in the U.S. Air Force (retired), a former curator of photography and now adjunct professor of art at the University of New Mexico, and recipient of three National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship Grants and a Guggenheim Fellowship. She has also written other articles and books, including <i>For God, Country, and the Thrill of It: Women </i><i>Airforce</i><i> Service Pilots in World War II,</i> published by Texas A&amp;M University Press.Noggle, a U.S. Women's Airforce Service Pilot during WWII, traveled to Russia several times between 1990 and 1992 to record the reminiscences of 69 Soviet women airforce veterans. Trained as combat pilots, mechanics, navigators and ground crews after Stalin ordered the formation of three all-female air regiments in 1941, their mission was primarily defensive. A number of them became aces-i.e., they shot down five or more enemy planes. This was the first instance of widespread employment of women in combat by a major power. The women talk about their reasons for joining, the extremely rigorous training and harsh living conditions, the way the Soviet military system dealt with them collectively and individually and the role they played in tactical operations. There is plenty of adventure, emotion and drama in these pages, and readers will note that the experiences of these women were hardly different from those of their male counterparts. Noggle writes movingly of the continuing friendships among the survivors (about 100 are still alive) and their twice-yearly meetings in Moscow for a vodka-fueled, sisterly celebration. Most moving of all: the noble photos taken by Noggle of these veterans in old age. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Blow By Blow - A Step-by-step Guide On How To Give Blow Jobs So Explosive That He Will Be Willing To Do Anything For You</h2><p><p><b>Fellatio</b>, the art (trust me, it&#x2019;s an art) of oral sex, is like playing an instrument.

But when a serial killer roams the sultry nights, even the corrupt cops can't see the clues. That is, until a letter from the Axeman himself is published in the newspaper, proclaiming that any home playing jazz music will be spared in his next attack.</p><p>Such brass invites a chase, and not just from the cryptic detective running the show. The New Orleans of 1919 is a place like no other, where the corruption runs deep and the bourbon rolls smooth, and control of this city is a prize only a fool would give up. Based on a true story, <em>The Axeman</em> brings to life the vibrant, volatile New Orleans of the Jazz Age, filled with as much desperate ambition as utter fear.</p></p><p>Ray Celestin lives in London. He studied Asian art and languages at university and is a script writer for film and TV, as well as publishing several short stories. The Axeman&#39;s Jazz is his first novel.<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p> <p>New Orleans, May 1919</p> <p>John Riley stumbled into the offices of the New Orleans Times&#x2013;Picayune an hour and a half after he was supposed to have started work. He sat at his desk, took a long, slow breath, and raised his eyes to peer about the room. Even in his befuddled state he could see his colleagues stealing glances at him, and he wondered exactly how unkempt he must look. He had been out the night before, at his usual spot on Elysian Fields Avenue, and he raised a hand to his face to make sure he wasn't still perspiring. When his fingers rubbed against a stubble at least two days old, he felt a pang of regret for not having sought out a mirror before his arrival.</p> <p>He looked at his desk, and his gaze landed on his typewriter. Its black metal frame, its crescent of type bars, its levers and keys all made the thing seem daunting somehow, cold and hard and otherworldly, and he realized he wasn't in a fit enough state to start writing just yet. He'd need a few coffees, a packet of cigarettes, and maybe a lunchtime brandy before he was ready to tackle anything requiring a fully functioning brain, so he decided to kill what was left of the morning with something that approximated work. He rose and stumbled over to the in tray where the letters to the editor were kept. He grabbed as many as he could, cradling them against his chest, and returned to his seat.</p> <p>There was the usual correspondence from irate residents, people with complaints, know-it-alls, and those who used the letters page as a forum for arguing with one another. He selected a few of the longer diatribes to print, as they filled up the page more easily, then he sifted through the letters from people who claimed to have seen the Axeman. Since the killings had started a few months ago, the office had been inundated with letters from concerned residents who swore they had seen him on his way to some murder or other. Riley sighed and wondered why these people sent these things to the newspaper and not the police department. He lit a cigarette and picked up the last letter in the pile. It was an unusual-looking envelope, rice-paper thin, with no sender details, and the newspaper's address was written on it in a spidery scrawl of badly splattered, rust-colored liquid he hoped was ink. He took a drag on his cigarette and opened it with a fingernail.</p> <p>Hell, May 6th, 1919</p> <p>Esteemed Mortal:</p> <p>They have never caught me and they never will. They have never seen me, for I am invisible, even as the ether that surrounds your earth. I am not a human being, but a spirit and a demon from the hottest hell. I am what you Orleanians and your foolish police call the Axeman.</p> <p>When I see fit, I shall come and claim other victims. I alone know whom they shall be. I shall leave no clue except my bloody ax, besmeared with blood and brains of he whom I have sent below to keep me company.</p> <p>If you wish you may tell the police to be careful not to rile me. Of course, I am a reasonable spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, you Orleanians think of me as a most horrible murderer, which I am, but I could be much worse if I wanted to. If I wished, I could pay a visit to your city every night. At will I could slay thousands of your best citizens, for I am in close relationship with the Angel of Death.</p> <p>Now, to be exact, at 12:15 (earthly time) on next Tuesday night, I am going to pass over New Orleans. In my infinite mercy, I am going to make a little proposition to you people. Here it is:</p> <p>I am very fond of jazz music, and I swear by all the devils in the nether regions that every person shall be spared in whose home a jazz band is in full swing at the time I have just mentioned. If everyone has a jazz band going, well then, so much the better for you people. One thing is certain and that is that some of your people who do not jazz it on Tuesday night (if there be any) will get the ax.</p> <p>Well, as I am cold and crave the warmth of my native Tartarus, and it is about time I leave your earthly home, I will cease my discourse. Hoping that thou wilt publish this, that it may go well with thee, I have been, am, and will be the worst spirit that ever existed either in fact or realm of fancy.</p> <p>The Axeman</p> <p>Riley took a drag on his cigarette, put the letter down, and wondered if its author really was the Axeman, and if not, who the hell else would send something like that to the paper? Authentic or not, it'd be a sin not to print it. Riley grinned and rose, and his colleagues turned to look at him as he marched toward the editor's office. He didn't care to wonder if he should tell the authorities before going to press-in instances like this, it was better to ask for forgiveness than for permission. They'd print it, and the city would read it, and a chaos would descend, and New Orleans might well spiral into the greatest night it had ever seen.</p></p><h2>COYOTE RAGE</h2><p>Bram Stoker Award-Winning author Owl Goingback makes a triumphant return to horror and fantasy in this gripping new novel.

Dolkart. "Not to the legendary ship that brought the Pilgrims to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1620, but to the more prosaic tenement on the southeast corner of East Broadway and Clinton Street named the Mayflower, where my father was born in 1914 to Russian-Jewish immigrants."</p><p>For Dolkart, his father's experience of being raised in a tenement became a metaphor for the life that was afforded countless immigrant children growing up in Lower Manhattan during the past century. In this revised edition of his classic book, Dolkart presents for us a precise and informative biography of a typical tenement house in New York City that became, in 1988, the site for the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. The author documents, analyzes, and interprets the architectural and social history of this building at 97 Orchard Street, beginning in the 1860s when it was erected, moving on to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when the neighborhood started to change, and concluding in the present day as the building is reincarnated as the museum.</p><p>This edition includes new research on the basement storefronts (specifically the Schneider saloon and the kosher butcher), the backyard privies and their reconstruction, and the new Irish Moore apartment. <i>Biography of a Tenement House in New York City </i>is a lasting tribute to the legacy of immigrants and their children, who were part of the transformation of New York City and the fabric of everyday American urban life.</p><p>Distributed for the Center for American Places at ColumbiaCollege Chicago</p><p></p></p><p><p>Andrew S.

Whereas many believe this lost treasure contains knowledge of the bloodline of Christ, William F. Mann shows that it actually consists of an ancient science developed before the Great Flood--knowledge discovered by the Templars in the Holy Land during the Crusades and still extant today in Templar/Masonic ritual. Among other things, this knowledge enabled the Order to establish accurate latitudinal and longitudinal positions long before the foundations of the current science were laid in the seventeenth century.

Whereas many believe this lost treasure contains knowledge of the Holy Bloodline--including the whereabouts of its descendants--William F. Mann shows that it may in part consist of an ancient science developed before the Great Flood, one discovered by the Templars in the Holy Land during the Crusades. Still extant in Masonic/Templar ritual today, this knowledge enabled the Templar Order to establish accurate latitudinal and longitudinal positions long before the seventeenth century, when the foundations of this geographic science were laid. It also allowed the Templars to cross the Atlantic and reach the New World, where, led by Prince Henry Sinclair, they established both secret settlements to protect the descendants of the Merovingian dynasty and mining operations that gave them a limitless supply of precious metals and a military edge over their opponents. <br> <br>Pursued ever farther into the interior of the North American continent by their adversaries from the Old World, the Templars left artifacts, relics, and information at key sites in the hope that future initiates could use their understanding of the science of meridians and ley lines to locate these caches. As Mann demonstrates, the history of the search for these Templar treasures has been intimately intertwined with the history of the United States and Canada, from the time of the first European explorers, the American Revolution, and the design of Washington DC to the Lewis and Clark expedition. <br> <br>WILLIAM F.

On that day the climactic and decisive phase of the war began. Those who survived the intense fighting on the Normandy beaches found their lives irreversibly changed. The day ushered in a great change for the United States as well, because on D-Day, America began its march to the forefront of the Western world.</p><p>By the end of the Battle of Normandy, almost one of every two soldiers involved was an American, and without American weapons, supplies, and leadership, the outcome of the invasion and ensuing battle could have been very different.</p><p>In the first of two volumes on the American contribution to the Allied victory at Normandy, John C. McManus (<i>Deadly Brotherhood, Deadly Sky</i>) examines, with great intensity and thoroughness, the American experience in the weeks leading up to D-Day and on the great day itself. From the build up in England to the night drops of airborne forces behind German lines and the landings on the beaches at dawn, from the famed figures of Eisenhower, Bradley, and Lightin' Joe Collins to the courageous, but little-known privates who fought so bravely, and under terrifying conditions, this is the story of the American experience at D-Day.

For three of those years the Western Front was, to them, a place to refit formations that had been shattered in Russia or a place to station inferior troops not trusted with front-line duty. The Nazi propaganda machine boasted about Germany&#x2019;s "Atlantic Wall," but until the latter part of 1943 the wall was more fantasy than reality. Two things happened in late 1943 that lit a fire under the Germans. First, they began to realize that an Anglo-American invasion of France was a real possibility. Second, they appointed their most prominent commander, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the great hero of North Africa, to command in the west.<br>Rommel toured the beach defenses and came away appalled. In almost every area along the coast, the Germans did not have enough mines, barbed wire, obstacles, pillboxes, cupolas, concrete, guns, or troops to repel the kind of invasion Rommel expected in 1944. He strongly believed that Germany could only win the coming battle by repelling the invasion at the water&#x2019;s edge. The first twenty-four hours would be decisive. If the Germans allowed the Allies a lodgment on the continent, their logistical, manpower, naval, and air superiority would inevitably overwhelm German forces. Only by turning the invasion coast into an impenetrable wall, ironically echoing the Nazi propaganda for which Rommel had little but contempt, could his forces achieve victory. The diminutive, dynamic German commander stood on a French beach one day in early 1944 and pensively told his young aide, Captain Hellmuth Lang, "The war will be won or lost on the beaches. We&#x2019;ll have only one chance to stop the enemy, and that&#x2019;s while he&#x2019;s in the water...struggling to get ashore. Believe me, Lang, the first twenty-four hours of the invasion will be decisive...for the Allies, as well as Germany, it will be the longest day."1<br>Rommel immediately ordered a dramatic strengthening of the beach defenses. Thousands of slave and local laborers poured millions of tons of concrete and steel emplacements. German engineers sowed millions of mines and beach obstacles. The latter mainly consisted of devices aimed at thwarting landing craft: mine-tipped logs, sharp hedgehogs, concrete tank traps, barbed wire, Belgian gates (steel contraptions designed to snare landing craft), concrete cones, even live shells pointed out to sea. Behind these initial obstacles, his commanders supervised the construction of pillboxes, observation bunkers, communication trenches, guns, and machine-gun nests with interlocking fields of fire. They made brilliant use of terrain. They even took steps to defeat an airborne invasion, denuding local forests to emplace sharpened stakes known as Rommel&#x2019;s asparagus. The asparagus were supposed to tear open gliders or impale descending paratroopers.2<br>The problem for Rommel was that he did not have total control of German forces in the west. He only controlled the armies defending Normandy and Calais. In effect, this meant he was subordinate to one of the German Army&#x2019;s elder statesman&#x2014;Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, a no-nonsense sixty-nine-year-old who was not afraid to speak bluntly, even to Hitler&#x2019;s retinue. Rundstedt, commander in chief of all German forces in the west, completely disagreed with Rommel. Rundstedt thought that a successful Allied invasion was inevitable. Germany could not hope to be strong everywhere along the coast. Nor could German mechanized formations, which would be desperately needed to repel the Allied Army in France, hope to survive under the muzzles of Allied naval guns. Bitter experiences at Sicily, Salerno, and Anzio had proven the potency of naval gunfire. To neutralize this Allied strength, Rundstedt wanted to concentrate German defenses inland, along defensible terrain, gradually employing powerful reserves in counterattacks, quite similar to the approach the Japanese would later take in such battles as Peleliu and Okinawa.<br>Hitler&#x2019;s mentality was more in line with Rommel&#x2019;s. The F�hrer usually wanted to defend every inch of conquered ground. In this case, he did not rule in either commander&#x2019;s favor; instead he divided power between them and maintained operational control over vital armored reserves for himself. In so doing, he ensured a dysfunctional command setup. Consequently, in the coming invasion, while Allied commanders worked together, German commanders often worked at cross-purposes.<br>* * *<br>One month after General Eisenhower received his momentous directive from the Combined Chiefs of Staff, his plan for Operation Overlord was mostly in place. Thousands of Allied officers and enlisted men had contributed, over the course of two years, to this final plan. Their first task had been to decide where to invade. The Pas de Calais area was, by far, the most desirable. Not only was it closest to England (about twenty miles at its most narrow point), but it also contained several excellent ports necessary for supply of the massive Allied armies. Its beaches were mostly flat and could support the armor and artillery necessary to support the infantry. Beyond the beaches, the terrain of Calais was mostly flat&#x2014;ideal tank country. A successful lodgment in this area would afford the Allies the chance to head straight east into Belgium and Germany. In short, Calais was the logical, even obvious, place for any invasion of France.<br>Given their preference, the Allies would certainly have invaded there. Unfortunately, the Germans fully understood the desirability of Calais and stationed their strongest forces there. By the spring of 1944, the powerful 15th Army, containing many of the best armored and infantry forces Germany had in the west, patrolled the area. The Germans expected the Allies to invade at Calais, not just because it was the most desirable invasion site but also because they believed the Allies would need the area&#x2019;s ports.<br>Indeed, the invasion planners had grappled with the same thorny supply issues. The disastrous Dieppe raid in August 1942 showed the strength, even at that early date, of German port defenses. Even now, two years later, with better trained and prepared assault forces, the Allies knew that such port assaults would be suicidal. To escape such a fate, they had designed, under great secrecy and with tremendous ingenuity, a plan to build artificial harbors of their own. These ports, code-named mulberries, made it possible for the Allies to invade beaches away from heavily defended ports.<br>In the end, the planners decided on Normandy. Normandy was well within range of Allied air cover, not prohibitively far away from sea bases in southern England, and contained beaches suitable for heavy armor and guns. Its defenses were not quite as strong as those of Calais, and it did feature a couple of attractive ports in Caen and Cherbourg. More than anything, an Allied invasion at Normandy would probably come as a surprise to the Germans, and surprise was of paramount importance. In order to neutralize the inevitable local superiority the Germans would possess in combat power, they must be kept guessing about the invasion&#x2019;s time and location.<br>To that end, the Allies perpetrated one of the great deception plans of all time&#x2014;Operation Fortitude. Fortitude was possible because of the success of British intelligence. The British had captured and "turned" every German agent in Britain. These agents provided the Germans with just enough good information to seem valuable, for example, the location of various Allied units or tidbits of gossip about commanders. The agents also fed false, but seemingly desirable, inform</p></p><h2>Serbian/English-English/Serbian Concise Dictionary (Hippocrene Concise Dictionary)</h2><p>A bilingual Serbian dictionary with over 7,500 entries that is easy to use for travelers and students.</p><p>Mladen DavidovicText: English, Serbo-Croation</p><h2>Justice League: The Art of the Film</h2><p>Inspired by Superman's selfless act, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans &#x2013; Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash &#x2013; to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.

She looks at Romantic and Christian social thought, and she shows that while the present political fatalism may be unavoidable, the prophets of despair have failed to explain the world they so dislike, leaving the possibility of a new and vigorous political philosophy.

These essays probe Paul's approach to scriptural interpretation, showing how Paul's reading of the Hebrew Scriptures reshaped the theological vision of his churches.<br><br>Hays's analysis of intertextual echoes in Paul's letters has touched off exciting debate among Pauline scholars and made more recognizable the contours of Paul's thought. These studies contain some of the early work leading up to Hays's seminal <i>Echoes of Scripture in the Letters of Paul</i> and also show how Hays has responded to critics and further developed his thought in the years since. Among the many subjects covered here are Paul's christological application of Psalms, Paul's revisionary interpretation of the Law, and the influence of the Old Testament on Paul's ethical teachings and ecclesiology.</p><p>Richard B. Hays is Dean and the George Washington Ivey Professor of New Testament at Duke Divinity School, Durham, North Carolina. He is internationally recognized for his work on the letters of Paul and on New Testament ethics. His book The Moral Vision of the New Testament was selected by Christianity Today as one of the 100 most important religious books of the twentieth century.<b>Luke Timothy Johnson</b><br>"In <i>Echoes of Scripture in the Letters of Paul</i>, Richard Hays distinguished himself as an interpreter of rare literary skill. He brings the same ear for scriptural nuance to this welcome collection of essays: <i>The Conversion of the Imagination</i> extends and strengthens the argument of <i>Echoes</i>, showing how little one can appreciate Paul without also appreciating the apostle's profound and subtle engagement with Israel's Scripture."<br><br><b>Victor Paul Furnish</b><br>"Richard Hays not only invites us to consider the formative role that Israel's Scripture played in Paul's thought. He also challenges us to learn from the apostle what it means to read Scripture faithfully, attentive to its 'gracious word of promise.' These are important essays, devoted to a critical topic, from a noted New Testament interpreter."<br><br><b><i>Anvil</i></b><br>"<i>The Conversion of the Imagination</i> is a must for anyone interested in the use of Scripture within Scripture. It will encourage and inform those who want to learn better how to listen to the Christian Scriptures themselves, as distinct from what others write about them."<br><br><b><i>Review of Biblical Literature</i></b><br>"Hays's own lyrical and evocative style of writing is an ideal vehicle for exploring Paul's own lyrical and evocative uses of Scripture. . . . Richard Hays has made a seminal contribution to biblical hermeneutics . . . . It is always fruitful to be in dialogue with him."<br><br><b><i>Reviews in Religion and Theology</i></b><br>"Makes some of [Richard] Hay's most important work more readily accessible to a new generation of readers. . . Merits sustained attention from all who seek to understand better the role and function of scripture in Paul's letters and thoughts."</p><h2>By Familiar Means (A Witch&#39;s Cat Mystery)</h2><p><b>In the latest from the author of <i>A Familiar Tail</i>,<i> </i>a witch and her familiar find trouble brewing at a coffee house.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> After discovering her mystical heritage&#x2014;and being adopted by furry feline familiar Alistair&#x2014;artist Annabelle Britton has decided to make picturesque Portsmouth, New Hampshire, her new home.

When not writing, she hikes, swims, gardens, cooks, reads, and raises her rapidly growing son.1<br><br>I want to be really clear about a few things. I do not follow people into abandoned tunnels, even if they are paying me. I do not remove valuable historical documents from private archives, and I do not believe in ghosts.<br><br>At least, I didn't used to.<br><br>My name is Annabelle Amelia Blessingsound Britton and I am (in order of appearance):<br><br>1) A freelance graphic artist<br><br>2) A brand-new resident of Portsmouth, New Hampshire<br><br>3) A witch<br><br>The last came as a major surprise. I found out about my magical background only when I arrived in Portsmouth. That visit was supposed to be for only two weeks-just long enough to see my best friend, Martine, and find a little relief from a (relatively) recently broken heart. Instead, I was plunged straight into a murder investigation involving the death of a local witch.<br><br>From all this, you may have guessed that my life had gotten a little complicated. This was, however, only the beginning. Now, not only had I invited my grandmother to come visit me; she'd said yes.<br><br>And she was early.<br><br>"Grandma B.B.!" I shouted as I bolted out the door and down the front walk.<br><br>"Hello, Annabelle, dear!" My grandmother climbed out of her massive land yacht of a car and spread her arms.<br><br>Grandma B.B. is more formally known as Annabelle Mercy Blessingsound Britton. I was named for her. She's plump and wrinkled and beautiful and tends to dress in the brightest available colors. This time, she'd gone with a distinctly tropical theme: a lemon yellow sweater with a glowing lime green jacket and skirt. Her cat's-eye glasses had rhinestones sparkling at the corners, and coral beads gleamed around her neck and wrists. And, of course, her white hair was covered by a filmy pink scarf, because she was a lady, and she was driving a convertible.<br><br>"I can't believe you drove the Galaxie all the way up from Arizona!"<br><br>"And why shouldn't I drive it? It's mine. Well, all right, it was your grandfather's. But really, for a road trip, why would I want anything else?" Grandma spoke in italics. She liked to make sure she was being understood, exactly. "You know I can't stand these little modern things. They're not cars; they're roller skates."<br><br>The car currently blocking my entire driveway was definitely not a roller skate. It was a vintage Ford Galaxie. Picture the ultimate turquoise-and-white 1950s dream machine-one with huge headlights, a retractable hardtop, and chrome everywhere you can think to put it. Naturally, there were tail fins, not to mention a trunk that could hold at least half a dozen bodies. I knew from direct experience that you could take four wriggling kids to the drive-in in that backseat and still have room for stuffed animals, blankets and popcorn. "Besides, it's a gorgeous drive, and I haven't been on the road in such a long time."<br><br>"That means, what? Three months?"<br><br>"Six, if you can believe it!"<br><br>We both laughed. Grandma B.B. was never anybody's little stay-at-home-and-bake-pies kind of grandma. When she visited us, every day was an adventure. Within five minutes of her arrival, Grandma always seemed to know her way around any town better than the people who lived there. She could (and would) talk to anybody about anything and find out all the important information, like where to get the best French fries and ice cream and what was the coolest stuff for a bunch of kids to do. She could also park that massive car in spaces you would swear wouldn't fit an Austin Mini Cooper.<br><br>"Now, let me look at you." Grandma backed away until she was holding me at arm's length. "Oh, dear!"<br><br>"I swear, I've been eating enough." I crossed my heart.<br><br>"You look beautiful, Anna." She patted my cheek, because she's a grandma and gets to do that. "Portsmouth agrees with you."<br><br>"Well . . . maybe. It's been kind of . . . eventful."<br><br>"Yes. I know," she said softly, and we were both suddenly looking around for ways to change the subject. Because what I hadn't known until a couple of months ago was that my wonderful, eccentric grandmother was a witch, like me.<br><br>This was something we would definitely be talking about, but later. For now, I just grabbed Grandma B.B.'s suitcase and a small, square train case off the Galaxie's passenger seat. "Is this all you've got?"<br><br>"Now, Anna, you know I much prefer to travel light."<br><br>This is just one of my grandmother's many mysterious talents. She could fit more into a suitcase than Mary Poppins could into a carpetbag. "Well, come on in. Everything's all set."<br><br>"I adore the house!" Grandma beamed at my fieldstone cottage as I led her through the gate and up the (very short) front walk. "Oh, Anna, you didn't tell me it was so lovely!"<br><br>Technically, the cottage wasn't mine-I was just renting it-but it really was lovely. Its slate roof was a complex landscape of peaks and gables topped by a weather vane in the shape of a crescent moon shot through with an arrow. The multipaned windows were glinting in the autumn sun and the spray of gold leaves and bright red rose hips that were what was left of the rambler roses added a splash of color across its mottled gray stone walls.<br><br>"I would have thought you'd recognize it."<br><br>"Oh, no," said Grandma. "I've never been here. When I left town, Dorothy and her family were still living over on Park Street. But I do recognize this beauty!" Grandma exclaimed to the large smoke gray cat pacing back and forth on the porch, blinking his blue eyes as if to say, What took you so long? "Hello, Alistair! Who's a good kitty?"<br><br>Grandma crouched down to scratch Alistair's ears. I wasn't surprised they knew each other. Grandma B.B. and Dorothy Hawthorne, the cottage's previous owner, had been friends back in the day. That day, however, was around fifty years ago, before Grandma decided to pack up and leave Portsmouth for good. Around about that time a very quiet but very intense feud had broken out among certain families in town. Alistair is not the sort to hold a grudge, though, and adopted me fairly readily. He's also ready to accept a good head rub from almost anybody. He began purring immediately, to let Grandma know she was a good human.<br><br>He also vanished.<br><br>I mean this literally. Like most things connected with the cottage, Alistair is magical. So, one second he was there; then-blink!-he was gone and Grandma's hand curled over empty air.<br><br>"Erm . . ." I felt myself blushing, which was a weird reaction to having my familiar demonstrate his showiest bit of magical talent, but it was the only one that seemed to be coming to me right then. I felt like I'd been caught sneaking Mallomars out of the back cupboard.<br><br>"It's all right, dear." Grandma straightened up and brushed her sleeves down. "It's nothing I haven't seen before."<br><br>That talk later was going to be a very, very long one.<br><br>I let us into the house. Grandma B.B. followed, exclaiming her approval of everything she saw, from the front parlor with its cushioned window seat to the formal dining room with the stained glass window. Even the narrow stairway that ran from the little foyer up to the second floor was "absolutely lovely."<br><br>I had set my studio up in the front bedroom, which overlooked Summer Street, but I'd moved the easel and other paraphernalia into the corner to make more room around the Arts and Crafts-style daybed and small dresser.<br><br>"I hope you'll have enough room," I said as I set Grandma's luggage on the bed.<br><br>"This will be just fine, Anna. I can fit anywhere."<br><br>The best thing about Grandma B.B. is that when she says stuff like that, she actually means it. She and my grandfather had traveled around the world at least twice. Together, they'd survived hurricanes, holdups and at least one military coup, and that was just the stuff I knew about.<br><br>Alistair leapt up on the bed and started nosing the luggage.<br><br>"Oh, such a good kitty!" cried Grandma, in, I swear, the same tone she used when I won second prize at my elementary school art fair. Alistair meowed his approval. "Yes, I brought you something, of course I did!"<br><br>Uh-oh. "Um, Grandma, you are not about to give my . . . uh . . . that is . . ."<br><br>"Familiar, dear. It's all right; you can say it."<br><br>I can, but it was going to take a lot to get used to hearing my grandmother say it back. "You are not going to give my familiar catnip, are you?" I'd recently learned the hard way that it's a bad idea to give 'nip to a cat that can vanish and reappear at will. I still wasn't quite recovered.<br><br>"Really, Anna, I do have some common sense."<br><br>I looked away, I hoped innocently.<br><br>Grandma reached into her purse and pulled out a bag of K.T. Nibbles. Alistair was suddenly purring and rubbing against her hand like he hadn't been fed in a week. There was a reason my cat had that big, soft tummy.<br><br>"Well, you've got a friend for life," I told Grandma as she let Alistair snatch a nibble from her fingers. She grinned up at me; she also winked in a manner that could only be described as conspiratorial.<br><br>That's my sweet little grandma.<br><br>A beeping started up from my back pocket. Grandma frowned at me and I blushed, pulled out my phone to check the reminder and shut it down.<br><br>"Sorry, Grandma, I wasn't expecting you until later . . ." It was still only ten in the morning.<br><br>"I know," she said as she unzipped her suitcase. "I made the most amazing time after I left Hartford this morning. Almost like magic." She smiled, and her blue eyes twinkled behind her cat's-eye glasses.<br><br>"Ummm . . . you didn't . . ." I began, feeling suddenly and distinctly non-twinkly.<br><br>"Oh, don't I wish I could! But no. Traffic magic is not one of my specialties. I just got up very early."<br><br>"But there is such a thing as traffic magic?"<br><br>Grandma looked at me owlishly over the rims of her glasses, and I had no idea whether or not she was actually joking. She must have seen my uncertain expression because she grew suddenly serious. "Anna, we are going to talk, about everything."<br><br>I sucked in a deep breath. "Yes, yes, we are."<br><br>"Merowp." Alistair peeked out from under the bed, indicating his relief that the humans were finally making sensible noises.<br><br>"But, like I said, I thought you'd be getting in later. I've got some things to do this morning."<br><br>"Oh. Now, is this business or . . . is there somebody I should know about?"<br><br>"It's clients, Grandma," I told her firmly. I had explained to Grandma B.B. that I was done with men, all of them. In fact, I had gone over this several times, clearly, carefully and in great detail. Somehow she never quite seemed to fully grasp the concept. "At least I hope it's clients."<br><br>"A new writer?" A fair amount of my freelance graphics work comes from independent authors who need cover art for their books.<br><br>"Actually, it's for a coffee shop called Northeast Java. They're moving to a new location and they want murals for the walls."<br><br>"How marvelous! Oh! I know! We can drive into town together!"<br><br>"You're not tired?" To New Hampshire from Arizona was a long way, even by Grandma's standards.<br><br>But apparently she didn't think so, because she just waved that all away. "Not at all. I took things very easy, and you know how refreshing travel is for me. I'd love to come out and see if I can still recognize my old town."<br><br>"Well, sure. Why not? Um, maybe you could go see Julia Parris? She's running a bookshop down near the square. Midnight Reads."<br><br>"A bookstore? Julia?" An odd look crossed Grandma's face, almost as if she was holding back a laugh, but that quickly faded into something more serious, and a little sadder. "Does she know I'm coming?"<br><br>"Yeah, she does." As soon as I'd invited Grandma to come up, I'd let Julia know. I won't say I was actively planning on repairing their friendship, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to try. After all, it was part of our job as witches to help and heal.<br><br>"Did she . . . say anything?" asked Grandma softly.<br><br>"Yeah, she did. She said it will be good to clear the air."<br><br>Julia Parris and Grandma B.B. had grown up together. But in the sixties, they'd both gotten caught in the feud that broke out among the "old families." The term was a euphemism for the families with magic in their bloodlines. Most of them had immigrated to New England back in the seventeenth century to escape the persecution in England, and then ran from Massachusetts to New Hampshire to escape the persecution in Salem. And it wasn't always the families you might think.<br><br>When the feud broke out, Julia Parris took her stand and stayed to face the consequences. Grandma B.B., though, had packed up with Grandpa Charlie and left town rather than take sides. Julia never forgave her.<br><br>Julia was now the head of the guardian coven of Portsmouth. The guardians were a group of witches who secretly-well, semisecretly-worked their magic for the protection and benefit of the town and its people. I had been accepted as an apprentice member of the coven, and Julia was my mentor. This all made for a few awkward moments. Julia is a good person, and a better witch, but she also has the spine and spirit of a native New Englander, which comes with a long and coldly accurate memory. I had not been at all sure how she'd really feel about welcoming my grandmother back to town.<br><br>From her expression, neither was Grandma.<br><br>2<br><br>Grandma B.B. found a parking spot right in front of the Midnight Reads bookshop, which made me doubt her protestations about traffic magic. Clearly, there was some kind of enchantment going on here.<br><br>As soon as you walk into Midnight Reads, you know you've found someplace special. Naturally, all bookstores are special, but they're even better when they're filled with that warm, dusty smell of paper, ink and wood polish. The front was very modern, full of open shelves and tables with the books laid out for easy access. There were all the latest releases-and a few surprises. A chalk easel listed the meeting times for the mystery club and the cookbook club, the Stitch 'n' Kvetch club and Saturday story time. One corner had been set aside as a kids' area. A Lego table and a collection of beanbag chairs were fenced in by low shelves painted in bright, primary colors.</p><h2>Day of Reckoning (Sean Dillon)</h2><p>For years, <b>Jack Higgins</b>'s "battalions of loyal fans" (<b>People</b>) have thrilled to his "rip-roaring" (<b>Associated Press</b>) novels of honor, bravery and irresistible intrigue. Now, the master of suspense reunites the powerhouse team from his explosive bestseller <b>The White House Connection</b> to bring down an international crime boss-and this time, there's much more at stake than duty and honor...<br><br>A journalist is dead after making the mistake of getting too close to international crime boss Jack Fox-but Fox made a greater mistake in killing her. Because the murdered woman's ex-husband is Blake Johnson, head of the clandestine White House department known as The Basement. Now Johnson and his Irish compatriot Sean Dillon are going to bring Fox's empire down around him.<br><br> But Fox is not a man who backs down for anyone. So if Johnson and Dillon want to take him on, they will have to face his own brand of revenge-and it is a revenge every bit as deadly as their own...</p><p>In Jack Higgins's new Mafia, no one wears gold chains or carries a tommy gun. Deals are done quietly and often resemble those in the "legal" business world. In fact, the tentacles of the Cosa Nostra extend into the most public of industries, including TV, film, and publishing. When <i>Truth</i> magazine reporter Katherine Johnson starts looking too closely at the life of millionaire socialite and mob boss Jack Fox, however, the veneer of gentility dissolves immediately. Her body is found one morning floating in the East River, and the coroner suspects foul play.<p> Wrenched by the pain of his loss, her ex-husband--former FBI agent Blake Johnson--decides to take the law into his own hands. In fact, as part of the secret White House department known as The Basement, Blake actually has the president's permission to take out Fox in the best way he sees fit. As Blake begins his Fox hunt, <i>Day of Reckoning</i> evolves into an international duel between the masterminds of justice and criminality. Blake struggles to exact his revenge by slowly undermining his opponents' businesses. And Fox matches him at every turn.</p><p> While the contest between the power brokers is compelling on the surface, Higgins is unable to infuse his characters with enough life to make the story as engaging as it might have been. The heroes and villains borrow heavily from the classic James Bond play book, complete with brandy snifters, brandname cigarettes, Saville Row suits, and secret, world-dominating empires. It's fun to read as a sort of homage to thrillers of the early Cold War period, but <i>Day of Reckoning</i> never matches the success of such earlier Higgins greats as <i>The Eagle Has Landed</i> and seems to fall all too frequently into clich�. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>4 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>In the Coils of the Snake: Book III -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy (Hollow Kingdom Trilogy, 3)</h2><p><p><b>Clare Dunkle's acclaimed fantasy trilogy&#x2015; now available in paperback</b></p><p>For thousands of years, young women have been vanishing from Hallow Hill, never to be seen again.

Dunkle</b> is also the author of <i>By These Ten Bones</i>. A native of north Texas, she and her family currently live in Germany.</p><p><strong>Chapter Two</strong><br>In the short time that Miranda had been in the kingdom, Marak had kept his ward very much to himself, determined that Catspaw would hold her the thrill of the unknown. Miranda had lived quietly in an apartment on the elves&#x2019; floor, content with her ongoing studies and Marak&#x2019;s daily visits. If she had seen almost nothing of Catspaw, she had seen very little else of goblin life, either.<br>Now the girl found herself propelled to the very center of goblin society. The new King kept her by his side at every social occasion, and the fascinated monsters thronged around her. Miranda played her part to perfection, exhibiting the fine manners and graciousness that Marak had drilled into her. She hid her true feelings from everyone--including, at first, from herself. <br>Because the fact of the matter was that many goblins were hideous. They didn&#x2019;t just look funny, as Marak had always said. There were deformities among them that sent a chill down Miranda&#x2019;s spine, a shock such as she might have felt at the sight of a corpse. She could barely swallow food in their company.<br>There was the goblin, for instance, with the huge flat head, burly arms, and tiny body. His doll&#x2019;s legs dangled uselessly a foot above the ground as he swung himself from place to place on his hands. There was the genial little goblin with the common abnormality, eyes of two different colors. One of his eyes was dark brown, twinkling with good humor. The other eye was huge and blood-red. And there was an entire family of goblins who were the color of dark gray earth, with the impression of things too long underground. Their hairless heads were round and bulbous, like soft rubber balls. Their pale eyes bulged alarmingly, as if they were being strangled.<br>Seen in the light of an honest day, these forms would have been frightful enough, but far worse was their appearance in the thick shadows of the kingdom. At any moment, Miranda might turn a corner in the dim hallways and find herself face to face with a horror she had never even imagined. And when she met it, she had to remember to smile.<br>It didn&#x2019;t occur to the girl that Marak&#x2019;s death had left her overwrought and that her repugnance was compounded by her grief. All Miranda knew was that she was acting the one part she had never known she would have to act. She had looked forward all her life to coming to Marak&#x2019;s kingdom and being a King&#x2019;s Wife. She had never once considered that it might be difficult.<br>*************<br>Catspaw leaned toward her as she glanced up and held her gaze with his own. &#x201c;My spells keep the lamps lit, Miranda,&#x201c; he said quietly. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t ever leave you in the dark.&#x201d;<br>Miranda was touched by his consideration. She hadn&#x2019;t imagined the goblin King like this. She saw her royal suitor as someone to charm and impress, but she hadn&#x2019;t realized that she would have to trust him. Maybe he wouldn&#x2019;t always seem like such a stranger, she thought with relief. She remembered Marak&#x2019;s last talk with her: <em>Catspaw will be all that to you.</em><em><br>&#x201c;That night when I was frightened, Marak told me about my future,&#x201c; she recalled. &#x201c;It was the first time that he said I would be a King&#x2019;s Wife.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then I remember that night as well,&#x201c; said Marak Catspaw. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of the only times I saw Father worried. I was up late studying political economy or some such when he came into my room. &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve got to marry that girl,&#x2018; he said, shaking his head. &#x2018;I just promised her that you would.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>Miranda felt startled. &#x201c;I thought he knew my future, he sounded so sure of it,&#x201c; she protested. &#x201c;I thought he could see it in my face.&#x201d;<br>Catspaw smiled at her. &#x201c;He was just being a King,&#x201c; he said. &#x201c;Kings are never supposed to seem uncertain. I don&#x2019;t see anything about your future in your face. I only see the character from the Door Spell.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You can see that?&#x201d; wondered Miranda, rubbing her forehead. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know it left a mark.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s gold, and it shines a little,&#x201c; said the goblin, tracing over the script character with his fingertip. &#x201c;I think it looks attractive.&#x201d;<br>Miranda pondered that, unsure how she felt about displaying a symbol that she herself couldn&#x2019;t see. She wondered how many other goblins could read it, and whether it really was attractive. Catspaw continued to study her, hesitating over something. If Kings weren&#x2019;t supposed to seem uncertain, he was breaking his own rule.<br>Then he leaned down and kissed her.<br>It was a nice kiss, Miranda decided. It made her feel appreciated, and she felt affectionate in return. For once, the smile that she gave her fianc� wasn&#x2019;t a charming mask but an honest feeling instead.<br>The goblin seemed to have enjoyed the kiss, too. He looked excited and resolute. &#x201c;Only two more months until our wedding,&#x201c; he remarked. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll erase this--&#x201d; He touched the Door symbol-- &#x201c;and write the King&#x2019;s Wife character there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Will I notice any difference?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;Yes and no,&#x201c; admitted Marak Catspaw. &#x201c;The doors still won&#x2019;t let you go outside, but they&#x2019;ll treat you with more respect.&#x201d; A little uncertain, Miranda thought about being his wife, living in luxury locked in by those iron doors. There certainly wasn&#x2019;t much left to worry about, was there? What a tidy future.<br>It was Sable who pieced together the clues and saw through Miranda&#x2019;s pretense. The elf woman listened to her son Tattoo&#x2019;s descriptions of the erratic behavior of the King&#x2019;s Bride and felt wholeheartedly sorry for the girl. It was clear to her that Miranda was struggling to find her place in the kingdom, and this was something Sable could understand. She herself had not had an easy time finding her place in life.<br>The black-haired woman combined in one person the sensitivity of an elf and the frankness of a goblin. Polite and distrustful, Miranda never mentioned her problems, so Sable did it for her. &#x201c;Goblins take getting used to,&#x201c; she told Miranda matter-of-factly, and the girl felt as if a weight had dropped from her shoulders. Miranda was too reserved to come by for a visit, so the elf kept inviting her over until the visits became routine.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re losing weight,&#x201c; Sable remarked one morning as she opened her door for the girl. &#x201c;I have bread and cheese for you on the table. Tattoo,&#x201c; she added crisply, leaning out in the hallway to speak to the young man posted at Miranda&#x2019;s door, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve mended your Guard cloak--again. Come by for it once you&#x2019;re off duty, and be more careful next time.&#x201d;<br>Miranda walked into Sable&#x2019;s forest room and looked around with pleasure. The illusion of a stretch of shadowy woodland worked particularly well for her because she couldn&#x2019;t distinguish much in the dim light. She sat down on a cushion at the strange low table that was only a few inches from the ground.<br>&#x201c;One week left until your wedding,&#x201c; noted the elf woman. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a shame that it won&#x2019;t be held at the full moon.

She hadn&#x2019;t yet promoted him into that exalted position, as the elf woman knew perfectly well.<br>A small silence fell over the room as Miranda pulled food from the basket and Sable began working on one of her math problems. She sketched it out rapidly in three dimensions a few inches above the table, silvery lines and circles appearing as she drew. Then she set it all into motion. Miranda watched the silver figure spin in the air, wobbling slightly as it turned.<br>&#x201c;Sable, did you always like it here?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;I was frantic when I first came,&#x201c; answered the woman absently, jotting down numbers.

And Marak never had to live with them like I did.&#x201d; <br>All in all, it was a strange coincidence that Miranda learned what elf men were like that day.

More than one hundred fifty years later, their clashes still reverberate in constitutional debates and political battles.<br><br>In this dramatic and fully accessible account of these titans of the early republic and their fiercely held ideas, James F. Simon brings to life the early history of the nation and sheds new light on the highly charged battle to balance the powers of the federal government and the rights of the states. A fascinating look at two of the nation's greatest statesmen and shrewdest politicians, <i>What Kind of Nation</i> presents a cogent, unbiased assessment of their lasting impact on American government.</p><p><b>James F. Simon</b> is the Martin Professor of Law and Dean Emeritus at New York Law School. He is the author of seven previous books on American history, law, and politics. His books have won the American Bar Association&#x2019;s Silver Gavel Award and twice been named <i>New York Times</i> Notable Books. He lives with his wife in West Nyack, New York.<b>Chapter 6: "The Fangs of Jefferson"</b><p>After he was selected to lead the Republicans' presidential ticket in 1800, Jefferson projected the image of a political ascetic, wishing only that his pure republican principles be put before the voters. He told his opponent, John Adams, that the presidential contest had nothing to do with their personalities, and everything to do with their conflicting political principles. "Were we both to die today," Jefferson told Adams, "tomorrow two other names would be put in the place of ours, without any change in the motion of the machinery."</p><p>As the candidate of lofty principle, Jefferson often appeared to view the day-to-day business of winning the presidency as beneath him, or at least irrelevant to his role as the Republican standard-bearer. His determination to avoid any opportunity to bring public attention to himself was apparent when he made plans to return to Virginia after the adjournment of the spring congressional term. He wrote Virginia Governor Monroe that he hoped to meet with him in Richmond before returning to Monticello. But he cautioned Monroe that their meeting should take place without the public's knowledge.</p><p>"Besides my hatred of ceremony," Jefferson wrote Monroe, "I believe it better to avoid every occasion for the impression of sentiments which might drag me into the newspapers." He acknowledged that the Federalists had put public displays to powerful political use, rallying support by furnishing occasions for "the flame of public opinion to break out from time to time." But Jefferson thought such public events unnecessary, even detrimental, to the achievement of his ambitious goals.</p><p>Despite his public image of detachment, Jefferson was anything but aloof in his behind-the-scenes political activities. He and Madison, in particular, discussed both broad issues of political principle and specific strategies for partisan advantage. Jefferson had firm ideas on how to exploit the growing fissure between the moderate and conservative Federalist factions over the second Paris peace mission and the related issue of a standing army. He knew that Adams and Marshall supported the peace mission and wanted to maintain the army only for defensive purposes, whereas the High Federalists, led by Hamilton, opposed any settlement with France and favored an expansive, permanent military presence.</p><p>Jefferson believed it was important that the Republicans give the warring Federalist factions no reason to unite on the issues. Republicans should continue to advocate a peace settlement with France without saying or doing anything that could provide the Federalists a pretext for keeping a large standing army in peacetime.</p><p>At the same time that he was setting the broad parameters of the Republicans' national strategy, Jefferson maintained a very active interest in his party's organization, down to the local county level -- as his directive to Virginia's Republican chairman to distribute Thomas Cooper's <i>Political Arithmetic</i> demonstrated. He was, moreover, vigilant in urging that the party's message be widely disseminated by the fervent Republican press and the party's most effective pamphleteers. He could justifiably deny that he was "the Chief Juggler" of partisan Republican writers like Duane, Cooper, and Callender -- but he knew and encouraged their work.</p><p>Jefferson also demonstrated a sure grasp of the electoral process. He prided himself on his ability to know how each state's electors were likely to vote, and indeed boasted that in the 1796 presidential election his prediction was within one or two votes of the outcome. He was somewhat less confident of his prognostications in 1800, but nonetheless ventured to make an educated estimate of the Republicans' chances. He conceded the New England states to Adams and counted most of the Southern and Western states in the Republican column, though he was concerned about Federalist inroads in the Carolinas. The election, Jefferson thought, would be decided in the Middle Atlantic states.</p><p>Jefferson had received reliable reports that the two houses of the Pennsylvania legislature -- one controlled by Federalists, the other by Republicans -- were deadlocked and would not agree on an electoral law, thereby neutralizing the state in the presidential election. Despite assurances from Republican supporters in New Jersey that his party would prevail, Jefferson was not prepared to make such a prediction. His attention, therefore, turned to New York, and more particularly to New York City, where the April election of the city's representatives to the state assembly would determine which party would control the state's electors -- and probably the national election.</p><p>The fate of the presidential election was, in effect, placed in the hands of the rival political leaders in New York, the Federalists' Alexander Hamilton and the Republicans' Aaron Burr. During the campaign, Burr not only demonstrated superior organizational skills but also proved to be a better strategist than Hamilton. Hamilton's task appeared somewhat easier than Burr's, since the Federalist incumbents already held a majority in the state assembly. But the Federalists made a fatal miscalculation by naming a lackluster list of candidates from New York City for the new assembly. Burr had shrewdly withheld his own slate of Republican candidates until the Federalists had named theirs. Once the Federalist candidates had been announced, Burr stunned Hamilton and other members of his party by announcing a dazzling Republican ticket that included some of the most illustrious names from the American Revolution -- former Governor George Clinton, Judge Brockholst Livingston, and General Horatio Gates.</p><p>Hamilton was furious that he had been outmaneuvered by Burr, whose Republican slate in New York City won, and took the desperate step of pleading with Governor John Jay to call a special session of the state legislature to nullify what appeared to be a certain Republican electoral victory in the state. Since the old Federalist-dominated assembly was still in office, Hamilton reasoned, the governor could ask the lame-duck legislature to adopt an electoral plan that would take the presidential vote away from the new Republican majority in the assembly and give it to the state's districts, where the Federalists were likely to be victorious.</p><p>To Hamilton, such an extraordinary measure was necessary to prevent a Jefferson victory, a catastrophe he compared to "the overthrow of the government...a revolution after the manner of Bonaparte." And if that specter of national disaster did not move Jay, Hamilton provided another: the governor must act "to prevent an <i>Atheist</i> in religion, and a <i>Fanatic</i> in politics, from getting possession of the helm of state." Despite Hamilton's dire warnings, Governor Jay refused the invitation to participate in the electoral scheme.</p><p>The New York City election, which appeared to clinch the presidency for Jefferson, dramatically lifted Burr's political fortunes within the Republican party. Although Burr had been on the Republican presidential ticket with Jefferson in 1796, he had never been fully accepted by Virginia's Republican establishment. Jefferson himself had met with Burr only once before the election. The 1796 election had only deepened Burr's distrust of the dominant Southern wing of the party when all but one of Virginia's electors withheld their votes from him.</p><p>With his brilliant success in New York City's election, Burr's name was again prominently mentioned for vice president on the Republican national ticket. The Republican House leader, Albert Gallatin, made inquiries about the availability of either George Clinton or Burr to run with Jefferson. Clinton declined for reasons of age and poor health.</p><p>Burr could well have afforded to turn down an offer to run with Jefferson, for he was almost assured election as New York's next governor if he chose to make the race. He let it be known, nonetheless, that he was interested in the vice-presidency, if he could be assured that there would be no recurrence of the 1796 electoral slight by Southern Republicans. He would agree to be on the ticket with Jefferson only if he received the total allegiance of his party, including the Virginia electors. After those assurances were made, Burr was officially nominated to the ticket with Jefferson at the Republican congressional caucus in Philadelphia.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Federalists were in disarray. Their hopes of retaining the presidency had plummeted with news of the Republican victory in New York City's election. Inside the party, the feud between Adams and Hamilton intensified. For more than a year, Hamilton and his followers had condemned Adams for sending a second peace delegation to Paris. With Adams's determination to support the peace initiative and his resolve to resist the High Federalists' demand for a large standing army, Hamilton had thoroughly soured on the prospect of a second Adams presidential term.</p><p>As John Marshall had reported to his brother James during the congressional session, Hamilton intended to undermine Adams's candidacy by urging Federalists to divide their support between the president and South Carolina's Charles Cotesworth Pinckney <i>equally.</i> Hamilton expected Federalist electors in all states but South Carolina to give Pinckney the same number of votes as Adams. In Pinckney's home state, Hamilton calculated, Pinckney would split the vote with Jefferson, not Adams. The result, Hamilton hoped, would be the presidential election of Pinckney, over both Adams and Jefferson.</p><p>It was a devious plan but one, Hamilton insisted, that was necessary to save the country from both Adams and "the fangs of Jefferson."</p><p>On May 15, Jefferson left Philadelphia for the last time. The three years he served there as vice president had been pocked with relentless political rancor, so he had few regrets about his departure. Jefferson returned to Virginia by way of the Eastern Shore, stopping briefly for a private visit with Governor Monroe in Richmond before reuniting with his daughter Maria at her home in Mont Blanco. At Monti...</p></p><h2>The Man Who Sold America: The Amazing (but True!) Story of Albert D. Lasker and the Creation of the Advertising Century</h2><p>We're living in the Age of Persuasion. Leaders and organizations of all kinds--public and private, large and small--fulfill their missions only by competing in the marketplace of images and messages. To win in that marketplace, they need advertising. This has been true since the advent of mass media, from mass-circulation magazines and radio through the age of television and the Internet.<br><br>Yet even as they use advertising to capture consumers' imaginations and build their brands, few people know of the ingenious and tormented man who built the modern advertising industry and shaped a new consumer sensibility as the twentieth century unfolded: Albert D. Lasker.<br><br>Drawing on a recently uncovered trove of Lasker's papers, Jeffrey Cruikshank and Arthur Schultz have written a fascinating biography of one of the past century's most influential, intriguing, troubled, and instructive figures. Lasker's creative and powerful use of "reason-why" advertising to inject ideas and arguments into ad campaigns had a profound impact on modern advertising, foreshadowing the consumer-centered "unique selling proposition" approach that dominates the industry today. His tactics helped launch or revitalize companies and brands that remain household names--including Palmolive, Goodyear, and Quaker Oats.<br><br>As Lasker rose in prominence, he went beyond consumer products to apply his brilliance to presidential politics, government service, and professional sports, changing the game wherever he went, and building a vast fortune along the way. But his intensity had a price--he was felled by mental breakdowns throughout his life. This book also tells the story of how he fought back with determination and with support from family and friends in an age when lack of effective treatment doomed most mentally ill people.<br><br>The Man Who Sold America is a riveting account of a man larger than life, who shaped not only an industry but also a century.<br></p><p>Jeffrey L. Cruikshank is an author or coauthor of many books, including Shaping the Waves: A History of Entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School. Arthur W. Schultz is a veteran ad agency executive who once headed Foote Cone &amp; Belding, the successor agency to Albert Lasker's Lord &amp; Thomas.<br>The Collier&#x2019;s reporter who interviewed Albert Lasker in Washington in February 1923 was struck by his subject&#x2019;s rapid-fire delivery and his elusive logic. <br>Lasker&#x2019;s brain was a furious express train,&#x201d; which seemed to run along six or seven tracks simultaneously. The train raced ahead at a breakneck pace, with every chance that when it reaches the terminal station it will go straight through the back wall.&#x201d;<br><br>For Lasker a 43-year-old advertising executive from Chicago who had temporarily transformed himself into a Washington bureaucrat this was nothing new; he had always lived his complicated life at a breakneck pace. But the second month of 1923 was proving unusually challenging even for the hyperactive Lasker. Now, as the back wall of the terminal station approached, he wondered how he might get off some of the tracks he found himself on.<br><br>For example:<br>He was engaged in a bitter and bruising battle on behalf of the President of the United States, trying to implement a coherent national maritime policy. Two years of hard work were on the line. He was losing.<br>Meanwhile, his advertising agency, Lord &amp; Thomas which over the previous quarter-century Lasker had built into one of the largest and most influential agencies in the U.S. was in financial peril.<br>At the same time, Lasker was suffering from a nasty case of the flu, which was causing him much discomfort. His only trips outside his Washington townhouse in the first week of February were to the White House, where he spent three successive evenings with President Harding and his wife Florence. The First Couple, too, had been felled by the flu. They seemed to find the presence of a friend and fellow flu sufferer one who was a little farther down the road to recovery comforting.<br></p><h2>The Art of Aging: A Christian Handbook</h2><p>The Art of Aging: A Christian Handbook [Paperback] [Oct 01, 2006] Eyrich, Howard</p><p></p><h2>How to Propagate 375 Plants: An illustrated directory of flowers, trees, shrubs, climbers, water plants, vegetables and herbs, with 650 photographs</h2><p><table><tbody><tr><td>Create plants for free with this A-Z guide to 375 of the best plants for propagating, including all the techniques such as sowing seed, taking cuttings, dividing plants, gorwing offsets, layering and grafting.<br></td></tr></tbody></table><br></p><p>Richard Rosenfeld began his career as a publisher, then became a freelance garden journalist.

No other commentary on Infinite Jest recognizes that Wallace clearly divided the book into 28 chapters that are thematically unified. A chronology at the end of the study reorders each section of the novel into a sequential timeline that orients the reader and that could be used to support a chronological reading of the novel. Other helpful reference materials include a thematic outline, more chronologies, a map of one the novel&#39;s settings, lists of characters grouped by association, and an indexed list of references. Elegant Complexity orients the reader at the beginning of each section and keeps commentary separate for those readers who only want orientation. The researcher looking for specific characters or themes is provided a key at the beginning of each commentary. Carlisle explains the novel&#39;s complex plot threads (and discrepancies) with expert insight and clear commentary.

Both were tall and clean-cut, about his age. They were respectably dressed in dark slacks and overcoats. At a glance, they appeared unthreatening. They could be bankers headed home after a late night at the office. College buddies hurrying to the Princeton Club for a last round before closing. More likely, they were two of the approximately three hundred guests who had suffered through the dinner given in his honor.<br><br> And yet . . . they disturbed him.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, sweetheart,&#x201d; said Bolden. &#x201c;What were you saying?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Where are you going to put it?&#x201d; Jennifer Dance asked. &#x201c;You know . . . in your apartment?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Put it?&#x201d; Bolden glanced at the large sterling-silver plate cradled in Jenny&#x2019;s arms. &#x201c;You mean I&#x2019;m supposed to keep it on display?&#x201d;<br><br> The plate looked like the one awarded to the women&#x2019;s singles champion at Wimbledon. This one, however, was engraved with the words &#x201c;Thomas F. Bolden. Harlem Boys Club Man of the Year.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d won plaques, medals, scrolls, and trophies, but never a plate. He wondered what joker at the club had thought it up. Curling an arm over Jenny&#x2019;s shoulders, he drew her close and said, &#x201c;No, no, no. This beautifully crafted hunk of lead is going straight into the closet.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You should be proud of it,&#x201d; Jenny protested.<br><br> &#x201c;I am proud of it, but it&#x2019;s still going in the closet.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t have to be the first thing you see when you walk in. We&#x2019;ll put it someplace discreet. Maybe on the side table in the hall leading from your bedroom to the bathroom. You worked hard for this. You deserve to feel good about yourself.&#x201d;<br><br> Bolden looked at Jenny and grinned. &#x201c;I feel fine about myself,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t want to be reminded how great I am every time I go take a leak. It&#x2019;s so . . . I don&#x2019;t know . . . so New York.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c; &#x2018;It ain&#x2019;t bragging if you can do it,&#x2019; &#x201d; Jenny said. &#x201c;Those are your words.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I was talking about dunking a basketball. Now, that&#x2019;s an accomplishment for a thirty-two-year-old white male who fudges about being six feet tall. Next time get a picture of that, and I&#x2019;ll put it on the table leading to the bathroom. Framed even.&#x201d;<br><br> Nearing midnight on a Tuesday in mid-January, the narrow streets of the city&#x2019;s financial district were deserted. The night sky hung low, gray clouds scudding between the skyscrapers like fast-moving ships. The temperature hovered at forty degrees, unseasonably warm for this time of year. There was talk of a major storm system hitting the Eastern seaboard, but the meteorologists looked to have it wrong this time.<br><br> The annual gala benefiting the Harlem Boys Club had ended thirty minutes earlier. It had been a ritzy affair: white tablecloths, champagne cocktails, a four-course meal with fresh seafood instead of chicken. Bolden had been too nervous about giving his speech to enjoy the event. Besides, it wasn&#x2019;t his style. Too much backslapping. Too many hands to shake. All that forced laughter. His cheeks felt like a punching bag from all the busses he&#x2019;d gotten.<br><br> All in all, the event raised an even three hundred thousand dollars. His cheeks could take a little roughing up for that kind of change.<br><br> A drop of rain hit his nose. Bolden looked up, waiting for the next, but nothing followed. He pulled Jenny closer and nuzzled her neck. From the corner of his eye, he saw that the two men were still there, maybe a little farther back, walking side by side, talking animatedly. It wasn&#x2019;t the first time lately that he&#x2019;d had the sensation of being followed. There&#x2019;d been a night last week when he&#x2019;d felt certain someone had been trailing him near his apartment on Sutton Place. And just today at lunch, he&#x2019;d been aware of a presence hovering nearby. A nagging feeling that someone was eyeing him. On neither occasion, however, had he been able to put a face to his fears.<br><br> And now there were these two.<br><br> He glanced at Jenny and caught her staring at him. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my Tommy,&#x201d; she said with her all-knowing smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so afraid of letting it go.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Letting what go?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The past. The whole &#x2018;Tommy B. from the wrong side of the tracks&#x2019; thing. You still walk as if you&#x2019;re on the mean streets of the Windy City. Like a mobster on the lam or something, afraid someone&#x2019;s going to recognize you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I do not,&#x201d; he said, then forced himself to push his shoulders back and stand a little straighter. &#x201c;Anyway, that&#x2019;s who I am. It&#x2019;s where I come from.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And this is where you are now. This is your world, too. Look at yourself. You&#x2019;re a director at the snobbiest investment bank on Wall Street. You have dinner all the time with politicians and big shots. All those people didn&#x2019;t show up tonight for me . . . they came for you. What you&#x2019;ve achieved is pretty damned impressive, mister.&#x201d;<br><br> Bolden dug his hands deep into his pockets. &#x201c;Not bad for a gutter rat.&#x201d;<br><br> She tugged at his sleeve. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious, Thomas.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I guess you must be if you&#x2019;re calling me Thomas.&#x201d;<br><br> They walked a few steps, and she said, &#x201c;Come on, Tommy. I&#x2019;m not saying it&#x2019;s time to join the Four Hundred. I&#x2019;m just saying it&#x2019;s time to let the past go. This is your world now.&#x201d;<br><br> Bolden shook his head. &#x201c;Naw, I&#x2019;m just passing through.&#x201d;<br><br> Jenny raised her eyes, exasperated. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been passing through for seven years. That&#x2019;s long enough for someone from Swaziland to become an American citizen. Don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s enough to make you a New Yorker? Besides, it&#x2019;s not such a bad place. Why don&#x2019;t you stay awhile?&#x201d;<br><br> Bolden stopped. Taking both of Jenny&#x2019;s hands in his, he turned to face her. &#x201c;I love it here, too. But you know me . . . I like to keep my distance. I just don&#x2019;t want to get too close to them. All the guys at work. The stuffed shirts. You gotta keep your distance, or else they suck you in. Like body snatchers.&#x201d;<br><br> Jenny put her head back and laughed. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re your friends.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Associates, yes. Colleagues, maybe. But friends? I don&#x2019;t recall getting too many invitations to dine at my friends&#x2019; homes. Though that may very well change after the looks I caught a couple of those sleazebags giving you tonight.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You jealous?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Damn straight.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Jenny smiled disarmingly.<br><br> She was tall and blond, with an athlete&#x2019;s toned body, and the best skyhook since Kareem. Her face was open and honest, given to determined stares and crooked smiles. She taught seventh, eighth, and ninth grade at a special ed school in the Village. She liked to say that it was just like the school in Little House on the Prairie, all the kids in one classroom, except that her kids were what the system labeled high-risk teens. High-risk teens were the bad eggs: the boys and girls who&#x2019;d been expelled from their ordinary schools and were doing time with Jenny until they could be reformed, remolded, and reassigned to a public school that would take them. They were quite a bunch. Drug dealers, thieves, hustlers, and hookers, and not one over the age of fifteen. She wasn&#x2019;t a teacher, so much as a lion tamer.<br><br> &#x201c;By the way,&#x201d; she said nonchalantly. &#x201c;Dinner&#x2019;s been over awhile and you still have your tie on.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Do I?&#x201d; Bolden&#x2019;s hand shot to his neck. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s begun. The body snatchers have me. Pretty soon, I&#x2019;ll be wearing pink shirts and white loafers and putting on tight black bicycle shorts when I hit the gym. I&#x2019;ll start listening to opera and o-pining about wine. I may even join a country club.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not so bad. Our kids would love it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Kids!&#x201d; Bolden stared at her, aghast. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re one of them, too! I&#x2019;m done for.&#x201d;<br><br> They walked in silence for a while. Jenny tilted her head on his shoulder and laced her fingers through his. Bolden caught their reflection in a window. He was hardly a match for her. His neck was too thick, his jaw too wide, and his dark hair receding quickly at the temples. What remained was thick and peppered with gray and cut close to the scalp. Thirty-two was definitely not young in his business. His face was stern, with steadfast brown eyes, and a directness of gaze that some men found intimidating. His lips were thin, rigid. His chin split by a hatchet. He looked like a man on equal terms with uncertainty. A reliable man. A man to have at your side in the lurch. He was surprised how natural the tux looked on him. Scarier was the fact that he almost felt natural wearing it. Immediately, he yanked off his bow tie and stuffed it in his pocket.<br><br> A New Yorker, he said to himself. Mr. Big Shot with a silver plate on the way to the pisser.<br><br> No. That wasn&#x2019;t him.<br><br> He was just Tom Bolden, a kid from the Midwest with neither birthright nor pedigree, and no illusions. His mother had left when he was six. He never knew his father. He grew up as a ward of the state of Illinois, a survivor of too many foster families to count, a graduate of Illinois&#x2019; most notorious reform school, and at seventeen, a felon. The conviction was sealed under court order. Even Jenny didn&#x2019;t know about it.<br><br> Arm in arm, they continued up Wall Street. Past number 23 Wall, the old headquarters of J. P. Morgan when they were the world&#x2019;s most powerful bankers. Not ten feet away, an anarchist&#x2019;s bomb had gone off in 1920, killing three dozen employees and bystanders, and upending a Model T. The chinks in the wall from the shrapnel had never been repaired and were still visible. Across the street stood the New York Stock Exchange, a huge American flag draped across the Corinthian columns, nothing less than a temple to capitalism. To their right, a steep flight of stairs led to Federal Hall, the seat of government when the nation&#x2019;s capital had been situated in New York City.<br><br> &#x201c;You know what today is?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Tuesday the eighteenth?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s Tuesday the eighteenth. And . . . ? You mean you don&#x2019;t remember?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, my God,&#x201d; gasped Jenny. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry. It&#x2019;s just that with the dinner and finding a dress and everything else . . .&#x201d;<br><br> Just then, Bolden dropped her hand and vaulted up a few stairs. &#x201c;Follow me,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Come on. Up here. Sit down.&#x201d; Turning, he indicated to Jenny to take a seat.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s cold.&#x201d; She eyed him curiously, then climbed the stairs and sat. He grinned, loving this part. The before. The wind blew stronger, tousling her hair around her face. She had wonderful hair, thick, naturally curly, as many colors as a field of summer wheat. He remembered seeing her for the first time. It was on the basketball court at the Y. She pulled off a between-the-legs dribble followed by a twenty-foot jumper that hit nothing but net. She&#x2019;d been wearing red athletic shorts, a baggy tank top, and Air Jordans. He looked at her now, wrapped in a black overcoat, collar turned up, her makeup just so, and felt his breath catch. Miss Jennifer Dance cleaned up nice.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the world coming to when the man&#x2019;s got to remember the big dates?&#x201d; Delving into an inside pocket, he pulled out a slim rectangular box wrapped in royal maroon paper and handed it to her. It took him a second or two to find his voice. &#x201c;Three years. You&#x2019;ve made them the best of my life.&#x201d;<br><br> Jenny looked between him and the box. Slowly, she unwrapped it. She hadn&#x2019;t even cracked the thing, and she was already getting teary. Bolden blinked rapidly and looked away. &#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> Jenny held her breath and opened the box. &#x201c;Tommy, this is . . .&#x201d; She held up the Cartier wristwatch, her expression stranded between awe and disbelief.<br><br> &#x201c;I know. It&#x2019;s vulgar. It&#x2019;s gauche. It&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><h2>Six Years in the Hanoi Hilton: An Extraordinary Story of Courage and Survival in Vietnam</h2><p><b>With a foreword by Senator John McCain.</b><br><br>In 1967, U.S. Air Force fighter pilot James Shively was shot down over North Vietnam. After ejecting from his F-105 Thunderchief aircraft, he landed in a rice paddy and was captured by the North Vietnamese Army. For the next six years, Shively endured brutal treatment at the hands of the enemy in Hanoi prison camps. Back home his girlfriend moved on and married another man. Bound in iron stocks at the Hanoi Hilton, unable to get home to his loved ones, Shively contemplated suicide. Yet somehow he found hope and the will to survive--and he became determined to help his fellow POWs.<br><br>In a newspaper interview several years after his release, Shively said, "I had the opportunity to be captured, the opportunity to be interrogated, the opportunity to be tortured and the experience of answering questions under torture. It was an extremely humiliating experience. I felt sorry for myself. But I learned the hard way life isn't fair. Life is only what you make of it."<br><br>Written by Shively's stepdaughter Amy Hawk--whose mother Nancy ultimately reunited with and married Shively in a triumphant love story--and based on extensive audio recordings and Shively's own journals, <i>Six Years in the Hanoi Hilton</i> is a haunting, riveting portrayal of life as an American prisoner of war trapped on the other side of the world.</p><p>Amy Shively Hawk is the stepdaughter of James Shively, who married her mother after his release from a Hanoi prison when Amy was five years old. Amy&#x2019;s background is in journalism, speaking, and advertising/marketing. She has a BA in Communication Studies from Eastern Washington University, and a minor in Broadcast Journalism. Amy is married to Steve, has a teenage daughter and son, and lives in Hood River, Oregon.<br>"I couldn't put this book down. In ten hours I cried through a box of Kleenex, laughed out loud, inwardly smiled, felt very nauseous, became extremely angry, then was filled with awe and gratitude. <i>Six Years in the Hanoi Hilton</i> should be required reading for every high school student in the nation. It is an American treasure, but then it was written about one. I am proud to have called Jim Shively a friend and I'm proud of his daughter. Amy is a gifted writer. Kudos to her for sharing her dad's story with the world."<br>--Debra Wilde, former news anchor and journalist, Spokane <p></p>"<i>Six Years in the Hanoi Hilton</i> is an outstanding tribute to a remarkable person. The story of Jim Shively truly shows off the best of the human spirit. Including the brutal, heartbreaking, and heroic six years he spent as a POW, this account also captures wonderful moments from his formative years, days as a fighter pilot, father, and family man. Amy has taken an extraordinary amount of history and detail and with wonderful storytelling has presented us the life of Jim Shively with a great deal of humanness and humor."<br>--Ken Hopkins, program director and morning co-host of the <i>Dave, Ken &amp; Molly Show</i> at 92.9 ZZU in Spokane <p></p>"As a classmate of Jim Shively at the Air Force Academy and a lifelong friend, I am truly ecstatic that Jim's daughter, Amy, has written this book. My wife, Sandy, and I have spent many, many hours not just reading the book, but discussing it in considerable detail. I have not read any other book on the POW experience that impressed me to the same extent. I believe the reader will be greatly pleased and blessed by the absolutely wonderful rendition and research by Amy. Jim Shively was truly a gentleman and man among men, and I will never forget his terrible wounds staring us in the face each day from his heroic resistance. Obviously, by this outstanding book, it is clear his spirit, courage, and excellence remain with us on earth in his daughter, Amy, as well as with him where he is now. Thank you, Amy, this book has been a spectacular confirmation of my very highest opinion of your dear father and my dear friend. All the best to you for its wonderful success, which I believe will greatly bless our country in many, many ways."<br>--Captain Guy G. Gruters, motivational POW speaker and author of <i>Locked Up With God</i> <p></p>"<i>Six Years in the Hanoi Hilton</i> is not merely a story of war, captivity, and torture. It is the story of a special man, one of the best and brightest of his generation. Jim Shively's faith, inner strength, patriotism, and humility were the hallmarks of a truly great American. He was a man of character and dedication to service. It was my distinct privilege to know Jim Shively. We became friends relatively late in his life. He shared many memories, some about his captivity in Vietnam. But mostly Jim offered a perspective on life filled with a rare honesty and sincerity that made every hour with him an honor. Through the pages of this book, that honor is now yours."<br>--Mike Fitzsimmons, award-winning radio and television journalist, news director, and talk radio host, KXLY Newsradio 920, Spokane <p></p>"A wonderful tribute to a great man. This book is great for Vets, family or friends of Vets, and just about anyone who appreciates our servicemen. The stories in Amy's book are heartbreaking, frustrating, but also inspiring. I love Jim Shively and I love this book!"<br>--Dave Sposito, morning co-host of the <i>Dave, Ken &amp; Molly Show</i> at 92.9 ZZU in Spokane<br></p><h2>The Logic of Life: The Rational Economics of an Irrational World</h2><p>Life sometimes seems illogical. Individuals do strange things: take drugs, have unprotected sex, mug each other. Love seems irrational, and so does divorce. On a larger scale, life seems no fairer or easier to fathom: Why do some neighborhoods thrive and others become ghettos? Why is racism so persistent? Why is your idiot boss paid a fortune for sitting behind a mahogany altar? Thorny questions&#x2013;and you might be surprised to hear the answers coming from an economist. But award-winning journalist Tim Harford likes to spring surprises. In this deftly reasoned book, he argues that life is logical after all. Under the surface of everyday insanity, hidden incentives are at work, and Harford shows these incentives emerging in the most unlikely places.</p><p><b>A Message to Amazon Readers from Author Tim Harford</b> <p></p> Give yourself a pat on the back. You're not as stupid as everyone says you are, and now there's a book that proves it. <p></p> When I first conceived of <i>The Logic of Life</i>, my aim was to show that a world full of smart people--people like you, that is--doesn&#x2019;t necessarily look logical on the surface. We eat too much and worry about being fat; drink too much and cringe when we remember; spend too much at Christmas and worry about the bills in New Year. And that&#x2019;s just the small stuff: what about crime, racial segregation, divorce, big-money politics? <p></p> And yet underneath it all there is a hidden logic. It isn&#x2019;t always pretty, but it&#x2019;s there if you know how to see it. That is what <i>The Logic of Life</i> is all about. <p></p> But when I'd finished the first draft, my editor told me that he didn't think that people were as logical as I'd said. He wanted me to prove my point. <p></p> At first, I thought it was my editor thinks people are illogical because he works in the publishing business. Of course life looks illogical if you do that. (In fact, life looks crazy in most offices: see "Why Your Boss is Overpaid," chapter four.) But then I realised he was right. I'd left the most important step out. <p></p> So I went back and made sure that I laid out all the amazing evidence. I looked at single women hitting the dating scene in American cities; I looked at juvenile delinquents across the US; I looked at Mexican prostitutes; I looked at traders at a convention in Disney World; I looked at professional poker players in Las Vegas and professional soccer players in Europe. I looked at violent spouses, alcoholics, and school bullies. <p></p> In every case I discovered a story of hidden incentives and unexpected logic. And through the process of writing--and living--the book, I discovered that this crazy world of ours makes more sense than you might think. <br><br>Tim Harford is the author of the bestseller <i>The Undercover Economist</i> and <i>The Logic of Life</i> and a member of the editorial board of the <i>Financial Times,</i> where he also writes the &#x201c;Dear Economist&#x201d; column.

Yet it had its dark side. The Aizu domain in northeastern Japan had staunchly supported the old regime. For this it was attacked by the new government's forces from Choshu and Satsuma in the autumn of 1868. Its castle town was burned to the ground, and during a month-long siege, whole families perished. After defeat, the domain was abolished and its samurai population exiled to barren terrain in the far north.<br><br>Shiba Goro was born into an Aizu samurai family in 1859. He was just ten years old at the time of the attack, which claimed most of his family. In the cruel world of exile, he lived with his father on the edge of starvation, struggling to survive. Eventually making his way to Tokyo, he became a servant, and though born in an enemy domain, gained entrance to a military school of the new regime. Shiba's abilities were recognized, and he rose through the officer ranks to become a full general - a singular distinction for an Aizu samurai in an army dominated by former samurai of the Choshu domain.<br><br><i>Remembering Aizu</i> tells of Shiba's earlier years. It is an extraordinary story that provides insights and material for a social history of the Restoration and its aftermath. But above all, it is a vividly rendered personal account of courage and determination, loss and remembrance.</p></p><p><b>Teruko Craig</b> is a senior lecturer emerita in Japanese at Tufts University and associate in research at the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, Harvard University.

Her father has enlisted her in two care-taking jobs -- baby-sitting for the rambunctious Wexler boys and, equally challenging, looking after Mrs. Randolph, her elderly, bedridden neighbor. To make matters worse, Katie has been forcibly inducted into the "loser" Girl Scout troop, compliments of her only new friend Cynthia's controlling mother. Her only saving grace is a trip to her childhood hometown in Texas, to visit her best friend Cherylanne. But people and places change -- and Cherylanne is no exception. When an act of betrayal leaves Katie wondering just what friends are <i>really</i> for, she learns to rely on the only one left she can trust: herself. <br> Full of the joys, anguish, and innocence of American adolescence, <i>True to Form</i> is a story sure to make readers remember and reflect on their own moments of discovery and self-definition.</p><p>In her 10th novel, <i>True to Form</i>, Elizabeth Berg finds her way into the year 1961 and into the head of 13-year-old Katie Nash at the start of her summer vacation. Katie's world is smooth and easy with endless possibilities and sunshine. You almost expect sitcom-style canned laughter when she whines in frustration or stomps up to her room and turns the radio way up, but then almost everything Katie does fits that era's squeaky-clean conventionalities. The younger daughter of a remarried widower, Katie craves popularity, a great summer job, and a direct line to the local DJ to make requests. Newly transplanted from Texas, she settles in with her only friend, Cynthia, who shares her views on status and appearance and boys. Between a regular babysitting gig for a household of little boys and caring for an elderly bedridden woman, her summer is off to a less than auspicious start. Cynthia's mother's plot to start a Girl Scout troop and to camp out for a weekend in their living room doesn't help. Berg's plot doesn't exactly mine new territory, but Katie emerges as a girl who sees the world differently from the rest of her peers. Her poetic perspective on her surroundings and her predicaments should eventually win readers over. The period backdrop feels unformed against this portrait of a young artist-to-be, but Katie imbues it with fresh eyes. <i>--Emily Russin</i><b>Elizabeth Berg</b> is the author of ten national bestselling novels, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>True to Form,</i> <i>Never Change,</i> and <i>Open House,</i> which was an Oprah's Book Club selection in 2000. <i>Durable Goods</i> and <i>Joy School</i> were selected as American Library Association Best Books of the Year, and <i>Talk Before Sleep</i> was short-listed for the ABBY award in 1996.

Having spent part of his childhood in Kenya, Vic has been drawing animals since he could hold a pencil. Being passionate about wildlife in general, and particularly in wolves, Vic works with a large number of animal welfare and conservation organisations worldwide, donating prints, merchandise and funds. He says: While I consider myself to be a wildlife artist, I prefer to paint close-up intimate portraits of animals as individuals, rather than in landscape settings. My aim is to capture not only the likeness of the subject in my painting, but also the life and soul in its eyes.From domestic cats to big cats, these beautiful creatures have fascinated people for thousands of years. Capture their elusive feline charm using a variety of art media in this useful primer. This book is aimed at the existing artist who wants to branch out into depicting members of the cat family. Total beginners are admirably covered by Search Press, but if you are somebody who has covered the basics and wants to specialize this book has most feline topics covered. Starting with a very basic look at anatomy and body shapes the topics discussed include sketching from life, key features, composition and different styles. Most of the book is divided into five medium types: pencils, pastels, watercolors, acrylics and ink. These chapters start with a brief overview of what you need and some techniques associated with portraying cats using that medium. Then follows a step-by-step project that puts the selected medium through its paces and shows how it can be used to advantage. The author's love and knowledge of the subject shines through, and gives the artist a good workout in capturing the essence of the cat. From getting the look in the eyes right to depicting soft fur this book makes it easier to decide what medium to use and how to get most aspects of the subject right. Handsomely illustrated with the artist's own work this is a good book for anybody wanting to paint pictures of the cat family. * Rachel Hyde - Myshelf.com * Award winning life artist Vic Bearcroft's latest book, Drawing &amp; Painting Cats focuses on both wild and domestic cats. "My aim is to capture not only the likeness of the subject to the painting," he writes, "but also the life and soul into its eyes." Here he shows you how to set about it - from initial sketching and the materials you will need, to the anatomy and the basic shapes of the cat, sketching from life and capturing movement. There are more detailed sections on important features to master, such as eyes and whiskers, as well as capturing cats in colour. These are divided into sections: watercolour, acrylic, ink and pastel. With plenty of advice on techniques, and four complete and detailed step-by-step projects for you to try. * The Leisure Painter * I had my doubts about Vic's previous book. I felt that, excellent as his wildlife paintings were, some of his backgrounds were a bit flat. I couldn't decide if this was deliberate - to push the main subject forward or not, but I felt a lack of impact. There are no such worries here. All the works in this volume are complete and the subjects are either set properly in context or isolated against a plain wash that's entirely suitable for a portrait. There's no doubt that Vic loves cats - it's apparent on every page, both in the way he depicts them and a hundred small details I'll leave you to find for yourself. His dedication indicates that he's lived with them and it shows. There are plenty of domestic moggies here, both young and old, alert and at rest and Vic captures perfectly both their physical and mental attitudes. My favourite is of a black Tom sitting on a roof in moonlight. Its posture and expression say both "I'm lord of all I survey" and "What am I doing here?". And that's pure cat. This understanding extends to the larger cats, too, and Vic has some excellent demonstrations of a prowling black leopard and of lions and tigers. He works in watercolour, acrylic, pastel, pencil and ink, so there's something for everyone. As long as you like cats, of course. * Artbookreview.net * This guide imparts a wealth of expert advice on drawing and painting cats of all types, from the tame pet to the powerful wild lion. An introductory chapter explains basic feline anatomy and offers tips for translating it into general body shapes and facial features. Bearcroft, an accomplished artist who is especially well acquainted with all cats, leads the reader through a series of easy-to-follow guidelines designed to produce realistic renderings conveying the feline spirit. Readers will learn how to sketch cats from life, or from photographs, as well as how to create finished drawings and paintings of this elegant animal in a range of media. The manual focuses on close-ups and portraits of individual felines. VERDICT Cat admirers of all artistic skill levels will enjoy this book. * Library Journal USA * May 2016 All animals present problems for the artist and cats can be the trickiest. Vic clearly loves them and this comprehensive guide to painting and drawing in media that include watercolour, acrylic, pastel, pencilis full of throughly practical advice. He understands that not just how cats look, but how they move and how they prepare for the next move. Even a sleeping cat can be a coiled spring and the ability to capture that sense of always-alert is the secret to a realistic picture. Vic demonstrates a prowling leopard as well as lions and tigers and, of course, cats and kittens at home. There's also plenty of advice on colours, techniques and anatomy to make this the complete guide * The Artist * September 2016 Would you like to draw or paint cats but aren't sure where to start? Not confident with using pastels? This book will soon have the creative juices flowing for all budding artists. Starting with the basics of sketching and working through a number of projects, beginners and more experienced artists alike will find Drawing &amp; Painting Cats and enjoyable addition to the bookshelf. Vic Bearcroft looks at each medium in turn with step-by-step photographs to illustrate a variety of techniques within each section. A snow-leopards eyes in watercolour, for example or a kitten's ear using pastels - there is something to tempt all tastes and skills. An intimate and in-depth guide to all aspects of drawing and painting cats, there are four complete step-by-step projects each with numbered diagrams so you can follow clear instruction before embarking on your own masterpiece. * Catworld *</p><h2>The House That George Built</h2><p>THE HOUSE THAT GEORGE BUILT takes readers through the process of how the president&#x2019;s house came to be&#x2014;starting with the contest George held to choose the perfect design for this legendary landmark, all the way to President John Adams&#x2019;s move into the grandiose home.

By the end of August, my peaceful English village would find itself at the mercy of rampaging brigands, bullies, braggarts, and blundering louts. There would also be an unexpected death.</p><p>None of us saw it coming. On the evening in question, my neighbors and I were sitting quietly&#x2014;some of us somnolently&#x2014;in the old schoolhouse that had for many years served as our village hall. We were there to attend a village affairs committee meeting, and nearly seventy of us had shown up because the annual May meeting was widely regarded as the most important committee meeting of the year.</p><p>The sole purpose of the May meeting was to finalize plans for Finch&#x2019;s many summer activities. It was, for the most part, an egregious waste of time, because everyone knew that the summer fete, the bring-and-buy sale, the gymkhana, the art show, the flower show, the dog show, and the tidy cottage competition would be run exactly as they had been run for as long as anyone could remember.</p><p>Innovations might be suggested, discussed, and debated, but they were never adopted. In the end, the same dates would be chosen and the same folding tables would be used, along with the same frayed linen tablecloths, tarnished tea urns, and increasingly shabby decorations. The summer fete would be held, as it had always been, at the vicarage, the gymkhana would take place at Anscombe Manor, and everything else&#x2014;apart from the tidy cottage competition&#x2014;would be staged, as per usual, in the schoolhouse. In the eight years since my husband and I had moved to Finch, the routine had never varied in the slightest.</p><p>The only thing that ever changed from one year to the next was the assignment of menial tasks to volunteers. The glamorous jobs had been snapped up as long ago as 1982 by women who would defend to the death their right to wear big hats and flowery frocks while opening the art show or graciously awarding ribbons at the gymkhana. Competition was understandably less fierce for the less glamorous jobs. No one fought for the right to iron tablecloths, empty rubbish bins, or pick bits of soggy crepe paper out of the grass on the village green. Since such toil was essential to the success of any event, however, volunteers had to be found.</p><p>It was left to our esteemed chairwoman, the all-powerful Peggy Taxman, to delegate the donkeywork, and it was for this reason, and this reason alone, that the May meeting was so very well attended. Peggy had it within her grasp to favor us with the pleasant chore of attending to the tea urns or to condemn us to the noxious duty of scrubbing the schoolhouse floor after the dog show. We were agog to learn our fates.</p><p>&#x201c;The meeting will come to order.&#x201d; Peggy banged her gavel, then pointed it accusingly at the room in general. &#x201c;And if I catch any of you napping, I&#x2019;ll have you removed from the schoolhouse!&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Barlow, who had already dozed off, woke with a start.</p><p>&#x201c;We done yet?&#x201d; he asked sleepily.</p><p>&#x201c;Just getting started,&#x201d; Miranda Morrow murmured from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; Mr. Barlow yawned, rubbed his eyes, and lifted his gaze to the five committee members.</p><p>The members sat shoulder-to-shoulder on one side of the long, linen-draped table that had been set up on the small stage at the rear of the schoolhouse. Peggy Taxman occupied the middle chair, a position which allowed her to loom menacingly over the assembled throng. Lesser villagers perched meekly on folding chairs on either side of a central aisle leading to the schoolroom&#x2019;s double doors, through which Peggy would sweep magisterially after she&#x2019;d made her final pronouncement.</p><p>No one would dare to stop her or attempt to dispute her decisions. An empire-builder by nature, Peggy ran two major businesses as well as the post office in Finch. She was a woman of substance, both physically and financially, and her fierce sense of civic duty drove her to rule the village with an iron hand, a steely eye, and a voice like thunder. A reproving glance from behind those pointy, rhinestone-studded glasses was usually all it took to make the bravest among us quail. When the glance didn&#x2019;t work, she employed the voice, and although I&#x2019;d never seen the iron hand in action, I had no doubt that, if all else failed, she would use it.</p><p>The other committee members were much less daunting. Sally Pyne, vice chair and tearoom owner, preferred gossip to governing and was content to let Peggy rule the roost. George Wetherhead, recording secretary and model train enthusiast, was so bashful that he rarely raised his eyes from the laptop computer he used to record the minutes. Mr. Wetherhead would no more think of contradicting Peggy than he would of challenging her to a wrestling match.</p><p>Our treasurer, Jasper Taxman, had been a retired accountant before marriage to our chairwoman had forced him to rethink his definition of retirement. No professional career could have kept him busier than his wife did. When he wasn&#x2019;t minding the tills in Peggy&#x2019;s shops or selling stamps in Peggy&#x2019;s post office, he was keeping the books for Peggy&#x2019;s myriad committees.</p><p>The last chair on the stage was assigned to the least important member of the committee: me, Lori Shepherd&#x2014;wife, mother, and hapless draftee. I sat at the long table because, having made the grave mistake of missing last year&#x2019;s May meeting, I&#x2019;d been appointed, in absentia, to the post of sergeant-at-arms.</p><p>All things considered, I&#x2019;d gotten off lightly. Although my title was impressive, my duties were not. I was assigned to keep order among the villagers during the meeting, and to distribute Peggy&#x2019;s work rosters after it. Since our chairwoman needed no one&#x2019;s help to keep the villagers in order, and since she wouldn&#x2019;t release the rosters until she&#x2019;d finished reviewing her copious notes, I spent most of the evening staring absently into space.</p><p>&#x201c;Item one,&#x201d; Peggy began. &#x201c;A few comments on fastening floral swags to the art show tables. Safety pins are considered unsightly and will not be used unless the following conditions apply. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>As if by magic, my eyes stayed open while my mind floated out of the schoolhouse. My first thoughts were, as always, of home. Finch was nestled snugly in a verdant river valley set amidst the patchwork fields and rolling hills of the Cotswolds, a rural region in England&#x2019;s West Midlands. I lived two miles south of Finch, in a cottage made of honey-colored stone, with my husband, Bill, and our six-year-old identical twin sons, Will and Rob.</p><p>Although Bill, the twins, and I were American, we&#x2019;d lived in England long enough to know the difference between cr�me fra�che and clotted cream, and to develop an incurable addiction to the latter. Bill ran the European branch of his family&#x2019;s venerable Boston law firm from a high-tech office on the village green, Will and Rob attended school in the nearby market town of Upper Deeping, and I divided my time between taking care of my family and serving my community.</p><p>Until quite recently, we&#x2019;d shared our home with the boys&#x2019; nanny, the inestimable Annelise Sciaparelli, but she&#x2019;d left us in mid-May to marry her longtime fianc�, Oliver Elstyn, and her room had been vacant ever since. With the twins attending primary school full-time, neither Bill nor I felt the need to hire another nanny, and we agreed that Annelise was irreplaceable in any case.</p><p>&#x201c;Item twenty-four . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Peggy&#x2019;s bellow jerked me out of my reverie.</p><p>&#x201c;. . . the proper use of dust bin lids!&#x201d;</p><p>I immediately sank back into a stupor shared by almost everyone in the schoolhouse. I couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time I&#x2019;d been excited about a committee meeting. My life was in many ways idyllic&#x2014;devoted husband, healthy sons, happy home&#x2014;but I&#x2019;d lately begun to realize that it was also just a tiny bit . . . boring. I loved my friends and neighbors&#x2014;most of the time&#x2014;but their faces had started to become a tad too familiar, their habits slightly too predictable. The daily routine of village life, which I&#x2019;d once found so fulfilling, had recently begun to seem a little too . . . routine.</p><p>As I scanned the faces assembled in the schoolroom, I acknowledged sadly that there wasn&#x2019;t much I didn&#x2019;t know about my fellow villagers. Mr. Barlow, a retired mechanic, was in the midst of cleaning the carburetor in a vintage Mustang he was restoring for a wealthy and recently divorced client who lived in Tewkesbury. Although Miranda Morrow was a strict vegetarian, she spent hours every day preparing the choicest cuts of meat for her cat. Lilian Bunting, the vicar&#x2019;s wife, was currently rewriting the third paragraph of her introduction to a book about stained glass. Dick Peacock, the local publican, had taken up pottery as a hobby, but the consensus was that his handmade goblets would do little to improve the taste of his homemade wine.</p><p>And so on and so forth. I knew without asking whose dog had fleas, whose roof had sprung a leak, whose grandchildren were angelic and whose were not. If Finch had any surprises left for me, it was keeping them well hidden.</p><p>&#x201c;Item twenty-five: Flower show entry forms. Block letters must be used when filling out . . .&#x201d;</p><p>While Peggy continued to drone, my gaze traveled to the portrait of the queen, hung in a place of honor above the schoolroom&#x2019;s double doors. I usually felt a small, Anglophilic tingle when I beheld England&#x2019;s gracious monarch decked out in royal regalia, but I&#x2019;d seen the schoolroom portrait so often that it no longer worked its magic.</p><p>Sighing, I looked down at my idle hands. If asked, I would have been forced to confess that I had no one but myself to blame for my growing sense of ennui. After the fiasco with the vampire in October, I&#x2019;d sworn to keep my feet firmly on the ground, and on the ground I&#x2019;d kept them for seven months, successfully stifling an inborn and nearly irresistible inclination to let my vivid imagination run away with me.</p><p>When Sally Pyne&#x2019;s gilded antique biscuit barrel had gone missing in January, I&#x2019;d clamped down on my desire to nab the thief and left it to Sally to remember&#x2014;two days later&#x2014;that she&#x2019;d loaned her precious barrel to Mr. Barlow, who&#x2019;d played one of the Three Wise Men in the Nativity play and needed a fancy container for the frankincense.</p><p>Similarly, when a stranger spent a cold February morning taking photographs of every nook and cranny in Finch, I <i>did not</i> allow myself to envision him as a predatory land developer, a fast-talking film location scout, or a devious foreign spy, and when I learned that he was, in fact, a real estate agent acting on behalf of clients who were about to buy long-vacant Crabtree Cottage, I <i>refused</i> to wonder whether or not those clients had sinister ties to the woman who&#x2019;d died there.</p><p>It was just as well, because the clients turned out to be Grant Tavistock and Charles Bellingham, who were sitting just below me, in the front row of folding chairs. The newest residents of Crabtree Cottage were a perfectly friendly pair of middle-aged art appraisers who&#x2019;d never heard of Prunella Hooper or her tragic demise, and who were so eager to fit into their new community that they&#x2019;d actually <i>volunteered</i> to clean up after the bring-and-buy sale. As I surveyed their shining faces, I thought pityingly, <i>They&#x2019;ll learn</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;. . . cacti and succulents belong to separate and distinct plant categories and will be judged accordingly, with no exceptions. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>My mind drifted lazily from cacti to flowers to the beautiful bouquet Annelise had ...</p></p><h2>The Black Death: Natural and Human Disaster in Medieval Europe</h2><p>A fascinating work of detective history, <i>The Black Death</i> traces the causes and far-reaching consequences of this infamous outbreak of plague that spread across the continent of Europe from 1347 to 1351.<br><br>A fascinating work of detective history, <i>The Black Death</i> traces the causes and far-reaching consequences of this infamous outbreak of plague that spread across the continent of Europe from 1347 to 1351. Drawing on sources as diverse as monastic manuscripts and dendrochronological studies (which measure growth rings in trees), historian Robert S. Gottfried demonstrates how a bacillus transmitted by rat fleas brought on an ecological reign of terror&#x2014;killing one European in three, wiping out entire villages and towns, and rocking the foundation of medieval society and civilization.</p><p><b>Robert S. Gottfried</b> is Professor of History and Director of Medieval Studies at Rutgers University. Among his other books is <i>Epidemic Disease in Fifteenth Century England.</i><b>CHAPTER 1</b><br><br><b>A Natural History of Plague</b><br><br>Like all infectious diseases, the Black Death has a natural history and can be properly understood only in that context. First, there is environment. Anyone traveling through Europe today would find it hard to imagine what the continent looked like a thousand years ago. There were no sprawling urban and industrial complexes, the outstanding characteristic of the last century, and surprisingly few towns of any size. Towns were usually far apart, located next to the sea or astride great rivers. By the middle of the twelfth century, a few urban centers in Italy and the Netherlands, and perhaps Paris, had fifty thousand or more people, but most claimed a thousand or so inhabitants. Nine out of ten Europeans lived in still smaller settlements, nucleated villages or hamlets of a few hundred people, fifteen to twenty miles apart. Both town and village were small and cramped, with woefully inadequate sanitation and transportation facilities. Ironically, in the confines of their small but isolated settlements, most people lived close together and had little privacy.<br><br>Surrounding the villages were the fields, pastures, and woodlands from which most people squeezed their subsistence. By 1250 or so, field and pasture had come to dominate Europe's landscape, but, until at least the mid-twelfth century, the extent and density of the woodlands characterized the European environment. In the far north -- most of Scandinavia and Russia -- the forests were coniferous, consisting primarily of fir trees, with a smattering of birch and, where the land was poorly drained and the elevation low, moors, marshes, and tundra. The rest of Europe had deciduous forests. The generally cold, wet, acidic-soil areas around the Baltic and North Seas and throughout much of eastern Europe had beech trees surrounded by holly and other aquifoliacs. Central Europe was mostly oak forest. Where the soil was alkaline, especially on both sides of the Alps and the Carpathians, the oaks were mixed with alders. Where the climate was wetter and the soil was more acidic, as in most of central and northern France and central Germany, the oaks were surrounded by birch and aspen. South of the Alps, in most of the Mediterranean Basin, the sunlight was brighter, the temperatures were higher, the rainfall was less frequent and less well-distributed throughout the year, and the soil was sandy and acidic. The Mediterranean Basin had also been settled longer than northern Europe and had a higher population density. Hence, it was less densely forested than the North; but, even in the twelfth century, much woodland remained, particularly stands of conifers, such as pines and junipers, which can tolerate sandy soils.<br><br>A second consideration in studying disease is causation. All epidemics, plague included, are caused by parasites that have relations with other, usually larger organisms. This process is a natural part of human and animal ecology. A third factor, and one of paramount concern to man, is toxicity. Epidemiologists generally distinguish between lethal and nonlethal diseases. Nonlethal infections are usually "old" and well-established. Often, they are only mildly deleterious to their hosts, thus ensuring a steady supply of victims. By contrast, those spectacular diseases that periodically burst onto the historical stage, killing large numbers of people, are caused by newer parasites that have yet to establish an equilibrium with their hosts. An example of an older disease is malaria; the plasmodium that causes it is debilitating, but generally not fatal. An example of a newer disease is pneumonic plague, which is 95% to 100% fatal. Both diseases have been significant in the past, but because of the plague's enormous mortality, it has had far greater impact.<br><br>A fourth concern regarding infectious diseases -- and, indeed, an important way of distinguishing one from another -- is their means of transmission. One such mechanism is direct contact between people, usually via the respiratory system. Diseases so disseminated include influenza, diphtheria, measles, and pneumonic plague. Respiratory diseases are highly communicable, virtually impossible to prevent, and closely related to human population density. Consequently, they were common in the cities and towns of medieval Europe. A second mechanism of dissemination comprises enteric diseases, those spread through the digestive system; among them are dysentery, diarrhea, typhoid, and cholera. Like respiratory afflictions, enteric ailments were very common throughout the Middle Ages. They often reflected social conditions, especially poor sanitation. Because of this, and in contrast to respiratory diseases, enteric diseases can be eliminated rather easily through basic improvements in public health.<br><br>Diseases are spread in at least two other fashions. One is through venereal contact, the prime example being the treponema infections, especially syphilis, and gonorrhea. The causative organisms of venereal ailments are highly vulnerable when exposed, even in temperate environments, and were less frequent in the Middle Ages than were either respiratory or enteric diseases. A fourth group, however, was very common -- diseases transferred to humans from animal hosts, with animals acting either as intermediaries, as with malaria or typhus, or as primary or secondary epizo�tic victims, as with bubonic plague. The role of animals in the spread of diseases can be crucial: humans share 65 different diseases with dogs; 50 with cattle; 46 with sheep and goats; 42 with pigs; 35 with horses; 32 with rats and mice; and 26 with poultry. While not as common as respiratory or enteric diseases, those transmitted by animals are usually more lethal, since most viruses and bacteria, the organisms that actually cause infection, gain in virulence as they pass through the chain of hosts.<br><br>In addition to their virulence, diseases facilitated by animal intermediaries are important for other reasons. They represent still another disease classification and interpretation in that their dissemination and frequency are based primarily on the animal hosts rather than on humans. Bubonic plague provides a good example. When a rodent population in which plague is enzo�tic, that is, indigenous, begins to multiply and reaches a certain population density, there is a concentrated transfer among the rodents of parasites -- fleas, in this case -- and bacteria. The result is usually an epizo�tic among the rodents, which sometimes leads to an epidemic of bubonic plague. Some scholars have suggested that communicable diseases are a basic part of the human environment and a function of the population density, and that civilization and disease travel hand in hand. Accordingly, the incidence of a given epidemic would hinge on patterns of human settlement. This is indeed the case with respiratory, enteric, and venereal diseases, but it is not so with those diseases spread by animal intermediaries. The latter are primarily dependent on factors exogenous to civilization, such as climate and rodent and insect population density and ecology. There is great danger when studying the history of infectious diseases in being too anthropocentric and overemphasizing the human element. In many epidemic diseases, humans are most effective as carriers when entering new ecospheres, such as the Americas in the sixteenth century, where they brought smallpox and measles, rather than in areas of older inhabitation, such as Europe in the Middle Ages.<br><br>Another key characteristic in the development of infectious diseases is immunity. Humans have complex mechanisms for defending themselves against pathogens, the microorganisms that cause disease. Individual resistance varies with many factors, such as number of protective antibodies -- the proteins generated in reaction to the disease toxins introduced into the bloodstream. Immunity is either innate or acquired; if acquired, it is either active or passive. Active immunity comes when the host generates his own defenses, passive when generated defenses are introduced. Passive immunity is often only temporary. In the Middle Ages, active immunity was particularly important in determining the extent and intensity of an epidemic. Some infections, especially respiratory types such as smallpox and measles, do not change a great deal in their etiology. Hence, survival from an initial attack confers a degree of immunity, limiting recurrence to those members of society born after the last epidemic. Diseases for which there was immunity had less of an impact on medieval Europe than did more complex, multiple infections such as dysentery, influenza, and plague, for which immunity is quite limited, if it exists at all.<br><br>Medieval infectious diseases were an inheritance from the classical world. Between about 500 B.C. and A.D. 550 there were extensive contacts between the animal populations and the civilizations of China, Central Asia, India, the Upper Nile, and the Mediterranean Basin. As a result, as William McNeill has argued, there was a general confluence of Eurasian and African disease pools which, by the sixth century A.D., brought to the Mediterranean Basin most of the important diseases that can survive in temperate climates. To be sure, this proliferation of diseases took a long time. With a few exceptions, such as the Athenian Plague of the fifth century B.C., the classical world was remarkably free from major, deadly epidemics. This was fundamental to its steady population growth, which continued almost unabated until the second century A.D. But this biological peace was deceptive; in fact, the peripatetic character of ancient empires acted as a conduit and incubator for future disease patterns. An example was the reticulum of commerce and communications established by the Romans late in the first century B.C. This included their famed road system and, even more important, network of commercial sea routes. The sea routes converged on the Levantine Coast, then branched east across the northern Arabian Peninsula to the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean, and South Asia; and west to Italy, southern Gaul, and Iberia, whence goods proceeded inland via major river valleys such as the Rhone. Sea travel was relatively quick and, with good weather, all Mediterranean ports were just a few days apart. Thus, a person who seemed well on embarkation could fall sick en route, infect fellow passengers, and then spread the disease hundreds of miles from its point of origin. Further, cargoes were often bulky enough to conceal potential insect and rodent intermediaries. This, coupled with the linking of south and central Asia, the Middle East, the Nile Delta, and the European coast along the Mediterranean, brought about the fruition of disease pools.<br><br>From the second through the sixth centuries A.D., three new and lethal infections emerged from this disease pool, bringing an end to the ecological stability of the ancient world. The first began in 165 and persisted until 180, striking Italy and the western part of the Roman Empire. It seems to have been brought west by Roman legionnaires and probably marks the introduction into Mediterranean Europe of smallpox. Some authorities believe that smallpox was concomitantly present among the Germanic tribes beyond the Rhine-Danube frontier, but, even if this were so, the barbarians apparently did not transmit it to the peoples within the Empire, at least not before the third century. Smallpox is one of man's most communicable diseases and can be very deadly to a population with no innate immunity. This was the case in the Roman Empire. The physician Galen estimated that between a quarter and a third of Italy's population died during the 15 years after it appeared. But because the smallpox virus changes little and survival of an attack generally confers immunity, its role in the Middle Ages was limited to areas it had yet to visit and to those who never had had it -- primarily children. Thus, it was as a killer of children that smallpox made its biggest mark in the medieval world.<br><br>Smallpox was joined in 251 by the second of the great epidemic diseases, marking the classical/medieval disease watershed. This disease was the "Antonine Plague," probably measles. It was described by St. Cyprian, bishop of the North African town of Carthage:<br><br>Now that the bowels loosened into a flux exhaust the strength of the body, that a fever contracted in the very marrow of the bones breaks out into ulcers of the throat, that the intestines are shaken by the continual vomiting, that the blood-shot eyes burn, that the feet of some or certain parts of their members are cut away by the infection of diseased putrefaction that, by a weakness developing through the losses and injuries of the body, either the gait is enfeebled, or the hearing impaired, or the sight blinded.<br><br>At its height, measles allegedly killed 5000 people a day in Rome, and it remained a major menace until about 260. Measles is like smallpox in many ways and the two diseases were not distinguished by European doctors until the sixteenth century. It is caused by a virus, transmitted via the respiratory system, and highly lethal to a population with little or no immunity. As is the case with smallpox, however, survival of a measles attack confers immunity from future visitations. Thus, it, too, was primarily a childhood affliction in the Middle Ages. Nevertheless, it is important not to diminish the effects of either disease, especially in their initial appearances. Measles depleted the population, hastened the desertion of many rural areas (particularly in the grain-producing regions of Sicily and North Africa), and cut the rolls of the Roman army and taxpayers. It caused at least a temporary reduction in East-West trade and, with smallpox, has formed the cornerstone of a major theory of the decline of the Roman Empire.<br><br>Important as smallpox and measles were in the natural history of infectious disease, their combined role was dwarfed by the arrival in 541 of a third disease. This was plague, caused by a complex series of bacterial strains called <i>Yersinia pestis.</i> Plague's etiology helps to explain its historical importance; <i>Y. pestis's</i> toxicity varies, but the disease is always highly lethal. Under normal circumstances, it lives in the digestive tract of fleas, particularly the rat fleas <i>Xenopsylla cheopis</i> and <i>Cortophylus fasciatus,</i> but it can also live in the human flea, <i>Pulex irritans.</i> Periodically and for reasons that epidemiologists still do not fully understand, the bacilli multiply in the flea's stomach in numbers large enough to cause a blockage, thus threatening the flea with starvation. The "blocked flea," while feeding, regurgitates into its victims large numbers of <i>Y. pestis</i> bacilli. This process is crucial to plague's progress; furthermore, <i>Y. pestis</i> cannot pass through healthy skin, but only through a break in the surface.<br><br>Dozens of rodents carry plague. Among them are tarbagons, marmots, and susliks in Asia, prairie dogs and ground squirrels in America, and gerbels and mice in Africa. Generally living in networks of tunnels just beneath the earth's surface, these rodents can be very numerous. In the Volga steppe in south Russia, an average of 325,000 susliks per four square miles has been estimated. In Europe, rats, especially the black rat, <i>Rattus rattus,</i> have been most important carriers. Black rats are quite sedentary and rarely move more than 200 meters from their nests. Because they live so close to humans, they are most dangerous to them. An excellent climber, <i>R. rattus</i> was well-suited to both the thatched roofs of peasant dwellings and the high roof beams and dark corners of urban houses.

By the time of the Revolution he was a rich man, a commercial and social leader in Philadelphia. He organized a clandestine trading network to arm the American rebels, joined the Second Continental Congress, and financed George Washington&#x2019;s two crucial victories&#x2014;Valley Forge and the culminating battle at Yorktown that defeated Cornwallis and ended the war. <br><br>The leader of a faction that included Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and Washington, Morris ran the executive branches of the revolutionary government for years. He was a man of prodigious energy and adroit management skills and was the most successful businessman on the continent. He laid the foundation for public credit and free capital markets that helped make America a global economic leader. But he incurred powerful enemies who considered his wealth and influence a danger to public "virtue" in a democratic society. <br><br>After public service, he gambled on land speculations that went bad, and landed in debtors prison, where George Washington, his loyal friend, visited him. <br><br>This once wealthy and powerful man ended his life in modest circumstances, but Rappleye restores his place as a patriot and an immensely important founding father.</p><p>Charles Rappleye is an award-winning investigative journalist and editor. He has written extensively on media, law enforcement, and organized crime.

Robert Webber designed this volume to show pastors, music directors, and other worship leaders the practical, structural, and theological steps for designing worship services characterized by biblical depth, historical awareness, and contemporary relevance. The author includes charts and forms at the end of each chapter that clearly show how music and other arts can be integrated with liturgical texts.</p><p>2001 Robert Webber is President of The Institute for Worship-Studies, affiliated with Wheaton Graduate School in Wheaton, Illinois, and Myers Professor of Ministry, Northern Seminary, Lombard, Ill. He has written more than a dozen books on worship (and other topics) and was the editor of The Complete Library of Christian Worship. He is active in the North American Academy of Liturgy.</p><h2>Beatty&#39;s Cabin</h2><p><i>Beatty's Cabin</i> journeys back to an amazing time when the Pecos high country of northern New Mexico was still wild and free. George Beatty, an old-time prospector, built his two-room log cabin on a grassy flat, beside the upper Pecos River, an area Elliott Barker grew to love. Beatty's cabin is the pivotal axis for Barker's thrilling memoir of his experiences and rugged adventures, many happy, a few tragic. He gets his first inspiring glimpse of the remote Pecos high country on the very same adventuresome trip when he first explores Beatty's old cabin and prospect holes. With the babble of the upper Pecos water and the whispers of the mountain breezes among the spruces, he begins chronicling his adventures, starting with his first wilderness pack trip in 1896 at the age of ten and continuing with the awe-inspiring glimpses of mountain meadows and rugged peaks. Elliott relates tales of grizzly bear hunts, capturing outlaws, and a perilous winter rescue of a bunch of snow-trapped horses, among others. The historical development of the Santa Fe National Forest and the Pecos Wilderness area, so dear to Barker's heart, form the foundation for this unprecedented memoir of the beauty and the glory of wild New Mexico.</p><p></p><h2>Landmarks</h2><p>A practical book that helps readers discover and deepen their own spiritual journeys.

Outstanding among these is the work that obsessed Mahler for seven years &#x2014; the imposing Symphony No. 2 ("Resurrection"), scored for soprano solo, alto, solo, full chorus, and a vastly expanded orchestra.<br>Plagued by incessant visions of his own death, Mahler composed a tone poem <i>Totenfeirer</i> (Funeral Rite) that was to become the foundation and first movement of Symphony No. 2, posing the great question, "To what purpose have you lived?" Mahler described the middle movements as post-funeral memories, nostalgic daydreams, and a harsh awakening to the meaningless realities of real life, answered finally by the angelic folk poem "Primal Light," the terror of the Last Judgment, and the salvation of resurrections: "With wings that I wont ... I shall mount to the light ... I shall die, so as to live!" &#x2014; an intimation of immortality through the monument of his works.<br>This profound work is presented here in full score with original instrumentation, bar-numbered movements, and with ample margins at the bottom of each score page for notes and analysis.

Ronald Wilson Reagan, the first actor to be elected president, turned in the performance of a lifetime. But that performance concealed the complexities of the man, baffling most who came in contact with him. Who was the man behind the makeup? Only Lou Cannon, who covered Reagan through his political career, can tell us. The keenest Reagan-watcher of them all, he has been the only author to reveal the nature of a man both shrewd and oblivious. Based on hundreds of interviews with the president, the First Lady, and hundreds of the administration's major figures, President Reagan takes us behind the scenes of the Oval Office. Cannon leads us through all of Reagan's roles, from the affable cowboy to the self-styled family man; from the politician who denounced big government to the president who created the largest peace-time deficit; from the statesman who reviled the Soviet government to the Great Communicator who helped end the cold war.</p><p>This is possibly the single best book available on the Reagan presidency. Lou Cannon began reporting on Ronald Reagan as a journalist when Reagan first ran for governor of California in 1966, and then covered him again in Washington after his 1980 presidential election. In short, there is probably no man or woman who has spent more years writing about the Gipper than Cannon. The result is a magisterial account of Reagan's two terms in the White House. Cannon is broadly sympathetic to his subject, but also coolly detached. <i>President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime</i> pulled off the remarkable feat of winning praise from both Reagan's admirers and detractors when it was first published in 1991. This reissued edition, which includes a new preface describing Reagan's postpresidential descent into the abyss of Alzheimer's disease, must now be considered the standard text on the subject--especially in light of the controversy surrounding the book that aspired to Cannon's mantle, Edmund Morris's quasi biography <i>Dutch</i>. <p> Cannon's book is full of wise analysis and sound observation. He explains Reagan's success convincingly: "Optimism was not a trivial or peripheral quality. It was the essential ingredient of an approach to life.... [Reagan] had a knack of converting others to his optimism, almost as if he drew upon some private reservoir of self-esteem. People who listened to Reagan tended to feel good about him and better about themselves." Though the book bursts with detail, it's never so cumbersome that it bogs down Cannon's narrative. And these pages give only cursory attention to Reagan's life before the White House; this is more a biography of President Reagan than of Ronald Reagan. Conservatives who are defensive about Reagan's legacy may bristle at certain points; Cannon's portrait is not always a flattering one. Yet it's a compelling biography of a compelling man's most important years. It's possible to imagine that a fuller biography of Reagan will be written some day. Right now, however, this is the best there is--and it's very, very good. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>Lou Cannon has been called "a reporter's reporter" by no less than George Will, who described Cannon's earlier book on Reagan's ascent as "the best guide we have to how Ronald Reagan became who he is and what he is." <p> Cannon, Bob Woodward has said, "is a great reporter." He "knows more about California, politics, the White House, the presidency and Ronald Reagan than just about anyone."</p></p><h2>How The Best Get Better 2</h2><p>Unprecedented rates of global change have made this the greatest time in history to be an entrepreneur.

The text, enriched with stories both humorous and poignant, includes details about the decomposition and embalming processes (an adult corpse buried six feet deep without a coffin will usually take five to ten years to turn into a skeleton) and describes the various customs associated with containing remains (the Igala people in Nigeria have a custom of burying people in as many as twenty-seven layers of clothing). Intriguing facts are revealed at every turn; for example, in Madagascar winter was considered the corpse-turning season.</p><p>This comprehensive book also includes a list of burial sites of famous people, images in the arts associated with death, fascinating epitaphs and gravestone carvings, a chronology and a glossary, and over a hundred black-and-white photographs, most of which were taken by the author.</p><p>Penny Colman writes with compassion and intelligence and humanizes the difficult subjects of death and burial. The result is a powerful look at an inevitable part of life-death.</p></p><p><p><b>Penny Colman</b> is the author of many award-winning books, among them <i>Toilets, Bathtubs, Sinks and Sewers: A History of the Bathroom</i>, a New York Public Library Best Book for Teens; and <i>Rosie the Riveter: Women Working on the Homefront in WWII</i>, an American Library Association Notable Book, a <i>School Library Journal</i> Best Book for Young Adults, and the winner of the Orbis Pictus Honor Award.</p><p>A popular guest speaker, Penny Colman lives in Englewood, New Jersey.</p><p>&#x201c;Understanding death doesn't necessarily take away our anxieties or fears about our own death, or our sadness about other people's deaths, but it does help us find ways to continue on with our lives.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Penny Colman</i></p><p>&#x201c;* A daring and satisfying approach to a difficult subject.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly, starred review</i></p><p>&#x201c;* Death, the last stage of the human condition, has been underreported and mostly avoided in writing for young people.

In this remarkable presentation of a fascinating subject, Colman uses her own experiences of death, and the ceremonies, rituals and emotions surrounding it, to lead the reader into an exploration of the place that disposal of human remains has occupied both historically and in our time. Colman does not shy away from grisly detail, but presents it to readers young and old, with sensitivity and a solid contextual grounding.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Children's Literature</i></p></p><h2>Boundaries for Codependents</h2><p>This inspirational pamphlet uses personal stories to help us better understand Step 2 and the need to seek the help of others in the Fellowship.</p><p></p><h2>The Duke That I Marry: A Spinster Heiresses Novel (The Spinster Heiresses, 3)</h2><p><p><em>Once upon a time there were three young ladies who, despite their fortunes, had been on the marriage mart a bit too long.&nbsp;They were known as &#x201c;the Spinster Heiresses&#x201d; . . .</em></p><p><em>Is it wrong for a woman to want more?</em></p><p>Not if she is a Spinster Heiress.

The world-famous author has retreated to England with his wife, Cora, in part to avoid gossip about her ignominious past as the proprietress of an infamous Florida bordello, the Hotel de Dream. In the midst of gathering tragedy, Crane begins dictating what will surely be his final work: a strange and poignant novel of a boy prostitute in 1890s New York and the married man who ruins his own life to win his love.</p></p><p><p>Edmund White is the author of the novels <em>Fanny: A Fiction</em>, <em>A Boy's Own Story</em>, <em>The Farewell Symphony</em>, and <em>The Married Man</em>; a biography of Jean Genet; a study of Marcel Proust; and, most recently, a memoir, <em>My Lives</em>. Having lived in Paris for many years, he has now settled in New York, and he teaches at Princeton University.</p>A biographical fantasia, White's latest imagines the final days of the poet and novelist Stephen Crane (<i>The Red Badge of Courage</i>), who died of TB at age 28 in 1900. At the same time, White also imagines and writes <i>The Painted Boy</i>, a work that he has Crane say he began in 1895, but burned after warnings from a friend. Crane dictates a fresh start on the story to his common-law wife, Cora Stewart-Taylor. Interspersed within White's impressionistic account of Crane's life, <i>The Painted Boy</i> tells the tale of Elliott, a ganymede butt-boy buggaree. Once a farm boy used by his widowed father and elder brothers like a girl, Elliott escapes to New York and begins a new life as a street hustler. Crane, dying overseas, asks that someone skilled and open minded complete the novella. The wry Cora, in her earlier career as a madam at the Jacksonville, Fla. Hotel de Dream, has some ideas of who among Crane's friends fits the bill. Though White's research and marshaling of slang are impressive, <i>The Painted Boy</i> approaches the sexual frankness of porn and reads improbably. But as White's book(s) build up steam, readers will let go of misgivings, caught up in Elliott's tragic love life and Crane's apocalyptic end. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Less than three hours later, she lay at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, having taken with her more than 1,500 of the roughly 2,200 people on board. Even now, a century later, no other ship in history has attracted so much attention, stirred up such powerful emotion, or accumulated as many legends.<p><i> Unsinkable&#x201d;</i> provides a fresh look at the <i>Titanic</i>'s incredible story. Following the great ship from her conception to her fateful collision to the ambitious attempts to salvage her right up to the present day, Daniel Allen Butler draws on thirty years of research to explore the tragedy and its aftermath in remarkable depth and detail. The result is a must-read for anyone interested in the <i>Titanic</i>.</p></p><p>The familiar story of the RMS <i>Titanic</i>--from her tragic 10-second encounter with an iceberg to her descent to the bottom of the ocean some three hours later, taking with her more than 1,500 lives--still looms large in the popular imagination. Daniel Butler, a researcher and archivist, worked on this book for 30 years, intensively compiling facts not only about the event, but also about the characters who played an important role, from the actions of Captain Smith and his crew to the inescapable fate of the third-class passengers. He also offers the startling revelation of a nearby ship which ignored the <i>Titanic</i>'s distress call because the shipmates were afraid to awaken their captain.<p> <i>Unsinkable</i> explores every facet of the <i>Titanic</i>'s history, from its conception to a modern-day researcher's attempts to salvage the ship. The author presents a contemporary view of the crew and the passengers aboard, creating a better understanding of the time and the social psyche that played a role in the disaster. Also of note is Butler's enlistment of a clinical psychologist to analyze Captain Smith's mental state as the drama unfolded before him. Butler's passionate yet balanced narrative permits readers to conclude for themselves who or what was ultimately responsible for sinking the unsinkable ship.</p>No other ship in history has attracted so much attention, stirred up such powerful emotion, or accumulated as many legends and myths as Titanic. "Unsinkable" is a fresh look at this incredible story, one that centers on the people who built the ship, crewed her, and sailed on her. It follows the great ship as she grows on the ways at Harland &amp; Wolff in Belfast, sails from Southampton toward her unexpected rendezvous with an iceberg, then slowly sinks into the North Atlantic, forever shattering the optimistic complacency of her era. The story doesn't end there, however, for the tale continues through the high drama of the U.S. Senate investigation and the British Board of Trade inquiry, then introduces the "mystery ship" Californian, whose officers watched Titanic sink and did nothing for fear of being subjected to their sleeping captain's wrath. The narrative then carries on with the recovery of many of Titanic's dead and their interment at Halifax, Nova Scotia, through the discovery of the wreck in 1985, and finally to the abortive 1996 expedition to raise a section of her rusted hull.</p><h2>Frank Lloyd Wrights House on Kentuck Knob</h2><p><p>This is the first thorough guide to the design and history of &#x201c;Kentuck,&#x201d; a splendid mountain house in southwestern Pennsylvania designed in 1953&#x2013;1954 by Frank Lloyd Wright. Inspired by Fallingwater, the famous house only seven miles away that Wright designed above the waterfalls of Bear Run, local businessman I. N. Hagan and his wife, Bernardine, commissioned the 86-year-old Wright to design this home. </p><p>Kentuck, constructed on an isolated knoll, or knob, is now owned by Lord Palumbo of London and is open for public tours. This vivid account tells the story of how the house came to be, detailing the many complexities faced by the Hagans&#x2014;from the delights and difficulties in dealing with Wright to the problems with topography and architectual plans. In fulfilling Wright&#x2019;s vision, the Hagans and their contractor managed to construct a building of great beauty, dignity, and serenity.&nbsp; More than fifty photographs, drawings, and diagrams accompany a detailed descriptive text to illustrate how the peculiarities of the plan, based on the equilateral triangle, resulted in a house that generates countless vistas, indoors and out, and spatial effects of great charm and intimacy. </p><p><i>Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2019;s House on Kentuck Knob</i> brings to life an unusual work of residential architecture. It is the perfect introduction to Kentuck, and for those who have visited there, a lovely reminder of this luminous but modest house.</p></p><p>Donald Hoffmann served as art and architecture critic for the <i>Kansas City Star</i> from 1965 to 1990, was assistant editor of <i>The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians</i> from 1970 to 1972, and is the author of seven books on the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, including <i>Frank Lloyd Wright's Falling Water</i>. <p>Previous books: <i>The Architecture of John Wellborn Root</i> 1988 <i>Frank Lloyd Wright : Architecture and Nature</i> 1986 <i>Frank Lloyd Wright's Dana House</i> 1996 <i>Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater</i> 1993 <i>Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House</i> 1992 <i>Frank Lloyd Wright, Louis Sullivan and the Skyscraper</i> 1999 <i>Understanding Frank Lloyd Wright's Architecture</i> 1995 <i>Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House</i> 1984 <i>Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House</i> 1988</p>&#x201c;[This book] vividly recounts the story of how the house came to be, detailing the many complexities faced by the Hagans&#x2014; from the delights and difficulties in with Wright to the problems with topography, architectural plans, and the siting of the mountain retreat.&#x201d;<br><i>--Pennsylvania Heritage</i></p><h2>Where the Lightning Strikes: The Lives of American Indian Sacred Places</h2><p><b>From the author of <i>How the World Moves</i>: A revelatory new look at the hallowed, diverse, and threatened landscapes of the American Indian</b><p>For thousands of years , Native Americans have told stories about the powers of revered landscapes and sought spiritual direction at mysterious places in their homelands. In this important book, respected scholar and anthropologist Peter Nabokov writes of a wide range of sacred places in Native America. From the &#x201c;high country&#x201d; of California to Tennessee&#x2019;s Tellico Valley, from the Black Hills of South Dakota to Rainbow Canyon in Arizona, each chapter delves into the relationship between Indian cultures and their environments and describes the myths and legends, practices, and rituals that sustained them.<br><br></p></p><p>Peter Nabokov is professor of American Indian Studies and World Arts and Cultures at UCLA. His previous books include <b>A Forest of Time</b>, <b>Native American Testimony</b>, <b>Native American Architecture</b> (with Robert Easton), <b>Indian Running</b>, <b>Two Leggings: The Making of a Crow Warrior</b>, and <b>Architecture of Acoma Pueblo</b>.According to UCLA professor Nabokov (<i>Native American Testimony</i>), the places that American Indians call sacred may be as wondrous as "cliffs spilling with waterfalls" and as humble as "caves splattered with bat excrement." What makes them important is not postcard-perfect beauty but the beliefs a group has about "what lies <i>within</i> or <i>beneath</i> what the eye can see." This excellent volume presents the "biographies" of 16 such places, from Maine to California. Through them, Nabokov surveys a wide range of Native American spiritual practices and reveals how intrusions into Native Americans' land have also constituted assaults upon their religious beliefs. Indeed, many of the assaults continue to this day: after the disruptions caused by war, disease, missionary activity and forced relocation came those of hydroelectric dams, agribusiness, parking lots and extreme sports buffs. Nabokov's deeply informed text is enhanced by first-person accounts of his visits to the locations and by his spirited commentary on the writings of other ethnographers, naturalists, linguists and anthropologists. Sentimental clich�s and monolithic views are dismantled along the way. Each of Nabokov's biographies can be savored separately; taken together, they demonstrate both that there is "more to some American places than [meets] the eye" and that Native Americans have known that for a very long time. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Le Guin's "The Day Before the Revolution" are also fine stories, but others don't succeed as well. The youngster who wants to fly the space-lanes in James Tiptree Jr.'s "The Only Neat Thing to Do" inevitably reflects the larger-than-life heroics of earlier genre fiction. Connie Willis's "Even the Queen" tries to be both feminist and humorous, but comes off as a sitcom pilot, while Bruce Sterling's "Maneki Neko" is too cute by a Pok�mon and a half. The volume concludes with a list of previous winners in a wide range of categories. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

By weaving history, family stories, travelogue and ecology, Richard Morris reveals how Yorkshire took shape as a landscape and in literature, legend and popular regard. The result is a fascinating and wide-ranging meditation on Yorkshire and Yorkshireness, told through the prism of the region&#39;s most extraordinary people and places.</p><p>Richard Morris is emeritus professor of archaeology at the University of Huddersfield.

In telling the story of Israel Potter's fall from Revolutionary War hero to peddler on the streets of London, where he obtained a livelihood by crying "Old Chairs to Mend," Melville alternated between invented scenes and historical episodes, granting cameos to such famous men of the era as Benjamin Franklin (Potter may have been his secret courier) and John Paul Jones, and providing a portrait of the American Revolution as the rollicking adventure and violent series of events that it really was. <br><br> This edition of <i>Israel Potter</i>, which reproduces the definitive text, includes selections from Potter's autobiography, <i>Life and Remarkable Adventures of Israel R.

Only twelve when his father died bankrupt, young Herman tried work as a bank clerk, as a cabin-boy on a trip to Liverpool, and as an elementary schoolteacher, before shipping in January 1841 on the whaler Acushnet, bound for the Pacific. Deserting ship the following year in the Marquesas, he made his way to Tahiti and Honolulu, returning as ordinary seaman on the frigate United States to Boston, where he was discharged in October 1844. Books based on these adventures won him immediate success. By 1850 he was married, had acquired a farm near Pittsfield, Massachussetts (where he was the impetuous friend and neighbor of Nathaniel Hawthorne), and was hard at work on his masterpiece <i>Moby-Dick</i>.&nbsp;Literary success soon faded; his complexity increasingly alienated readers. After a visit to the Holy Land in January 1857, he turned from writing prose fiction to poetry. In 1863, during the Civil War, he moved back to New York City, where from 1866-1885 he was a deputy inspector in the Custom House, and where, in 1891, he died. A draft of a final prose work,&nbsp;<i>Billy Budd, Sailor</i>, was left unfinished and uncollated, packed&nbsp;tidily away by his widow, where it remained until its rediscovery and publication in 1924.<b><br> </b><p><b>Robert S.

Yet despite these catastrophic death tolls, the pandemic faded from historical and cultural memory in the United States and throughout Europe, overshadowed by World War One and the turmoil of the interwar period. In <i>Viral Modernism</i>, Elizabeth Outka reveals the literary and cultural impact of one of the deadliest plagues in history, bringing to light how it shaped canonical works of fiction and poetry.<br><br>Outka shows how and why the contours of modernism shift when we account for the pandemic&#x2019;s hidden but widespread presence. She investigates the miasmic manifestations of the pandemic and its spectral dead in interwar Anglo-American literature, uncovering the traces of an outbreak that brought a nonhuman, invisible horror into every community. <i>Viral Modernism</i> examines how literature and culture represented the virus&#x2019;s deathly fecundity, as writers wrestled with the scope of mass death in the domestic sphere amid fears of wider social collapse. Outka analyzes overt treatments of the pandemic by authors like Katherine Anne Porter and Thomas Wolfe and its subtle presence in works by Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, and W. B. Yeats. She uncovers links to the disease in popular culture, from early zombie resurrection to the resurgence of spiritualism. <i>Viral Modernism</i> brings the pandemic to the center of the era, revealing a vast tragedy that has hidden in plain sight.</p><p>Elizabeth Outka is associate professor of English at the University of Richmond. She is the author of <i>Consuming Traditions: Modernity, Modernism, and the Commodified Authentic</i> (2009).Elizabeth Outka answers a question that has hardly been asked, let alone answered: where is the flu in modernism? It is one of those books whose importance is written into its DNA. Adjusting our eyes so that we can see the shadowy presence of the pandemic, Outka gives us a new vision of modernism, vulnerable and embodied. Steeped in a rich and riveting archive, <i>Viral Modernism </i>offers transformative insights into the motivation and meaning of modernist texts, attuning us to the troubling ways illness can disappear from our cultural memory. (Sarah Cole, author of <i>Inventing Tomorrow: H. G. Wells and the Twentieth Century</i>)<br><br>How and why, asks Elizabeth Outka, have we missed &#x201c;the viral tragedy within iconic modernist texts&#x201d;? And what do we learn when we listen for it? <i>Viral Modernism</i> resuscitates the buried stories of the 1918&#x2013;1919 influenza pandemic in relation to modernist literary form. The voices that surface through the exquisite readings of this well-researched, well-argued study offer insight not only into the tragic experience of this devastating disease but also into how those affected use literary and cultural forms to make sense of that experience, hence into the nature of storytelling itself. (Priscilla Wald, author of <i>Contagious: Cultures, Carriers, and the Outbreak Narrative</i>)<br><br><i>Viral Modernism</i> is an elegantly written, penetrating study of how the influenza pandemic of 1918&#x2013;1919 shaped modernist literature and society, most notably in Clarissa&#x2019;s illnesses in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>; the burning thirst and drowning in <i>The Waste Land</i>; and the influence of Yeats&#x2019;s stricken, pregnant wife as he wrote &#x201c;The Second Coming.&#x201d; (Stephen Kern, author of <i>The Culture of Time and Space, 1880-1918</i>)<br><br><i>Viral Modernism </i>navigates deftly between history and literature and presents transformative readings of some of the most canonical high modernist works. Along the way, Elizabeth Outka offers a moving and harrowing account of the challenges the influenza pandemic posed to those who lived through it. Readers will talk about this book with friends and family, and the field will never be able to ignore the pandemic again. An extraordinary achievement.

Now America&#x2019;s favorite bakery-cafe offers a practical guide to baking artisan breads at home, along with more than 120 recipes for tantalizing dishes that begin with handcrafted bread&#x2014;whether you&#x2019;re baking your own or starting with a warm, crusty loaf fresh from your local bakery.<br><br>Panera&#x2019;s expert bakers guide you through the six easy steps to successful bread-making at home, outlining the ingredients, tools, and techniques that guarantee a perfect loaf.

Innovative sandwiches such as Fuji Apple and Fontina Panini and new twists on family favorites like Bananas Foster French Toast showcase the bold flavors and remarkable textures of breads like Kalamata Olive, Raisin Pecan, Three-Cheese, and Focaccia. Panera Bread also shares, for the first time ever, a handful of recipes from their award-winning bakery-cafe menu.<br><br>A thorough introduction to bread-making for beginners and an indispensable reference for experienced bakers, <i>The Panera Bread Cookbook</i> is a celebration of this eternal comfort food&#x2014;a must-own for bread lovers and bakers everywhere.</p><p>Panera Bread freshly bakes more bread each day than any other bakery-cafe in the country. Every day, at every location, expert bakers handcraft each loaf from scratch, using all-natural ingredients to deliver fresh, authentic artisan breads to hundreds of neighborhoods nationwide.If you haven&#x2019;t heard of Panera Bread or come across one in your neighborhood, that&#x2019;s likely to change soon. With 669 bakery-caf�s in 35 states and 145 more to come this year, Panera Bread has been expanding rapidly since its founding in 1981, giving consumers across the nation a taste of artisan breads. As Peter Reinhart acknowledges in his introduction, to enjoy artisan bread in the current carbohydrate-phobic climate, much less bake one&#x2019;s own, verges on heretical. But the Panera Bread Team, banking on the caf�&#x2019;s name and America&#x2019;s continuing obsession with the yeasty loaves, offers this simple cookbook, which is surprisingly short on bread recipes. The first few chapters do describe how to bake artisan breads at home using real baker&#x2019;s formulas, but they omit any discussion of kneading, assuming instead that the baker will be using a mixer. A smattering of basic and advanced bread recipes follow, including Country White Bread, Kalamata Olive Bread and Vegetable Wheat Bread. Taken in combination with the earlier bread-making tips, the recipes will be fairly easy to follow for anyone with baking experience, but they are not for absolute beginners. The rest of the cookbook is friendlier to bakers who don&#x2019;t want to tackle making the actual bread used in the recipe. Dishes like Eggs Goldenrod with Hot Hungarian Paprika call for slices of the Country White Bread, but the authors allow that purchased multi-grain bread can substitute. And even the carb-averse will be able to stomach the Fandango Salad, an "exclusive Panera Bread menu favorite" made up of walnuts, greens, raspberry vinaigrette, cheese and Mandarin oranges. Anyone looking to recreate Panera&#x2019;s signature breads will be disappointed by this compilation, but those more interested in the caf� side of the restaurant should find plenty here to satisfy.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The story is fast-paced and barely lets up from the word "go," lightened with plenty of wry humor and more than a dash of romance. In Cassie's last adventure, TOUCH THE DARK, the focus was on vampires. Here, we see more about the mages, especially Cassie's nemesis Pritkin. It's obvious that Chance has even more wonders to reveal, and I am very much looking forward to the next installment of Cassie's adventures. -- <i>Rambles.com</i><br><br>Magic aplenty populates this fast moving, rather dark tale of power, corruption, double-dealings and painful attractions as Cassie comes to grips with her new role in this follow-up to TOUCH THE DARK.

Cassie remains the funny and smart heroine we came to love in book one. She solves her own problems and trusts her intuition. This is a series well worth getting hooked on. -- <i>FreshFiction.com</i><br><br>The much anticipated sequel to TOUCH THE DARK, CLAIMED BY SHADOW picks up right where Cassie left off in the first book, infused with a power she doesn't want. From tacky Vegas showgirl costumes to moveable tattoo parlors to a zombie Elvis, Karen Chance takes readers on another wild ride with never-ending action. CLAIMED BY SHADOW should not be missed. -- <i>Romance Reviews Today</i><br><br>The second installment of Karen Chance's paranormal fantasy saga to feature psychic Cassandra Palmer (after 2006's Touch the Dark) explores new territory, as the 23-year-old heroine is forced to deal with the unfathomable power -- and danger -- associated with being the heir to the Pythia, the world's most influential clairvoyant. Palmer's newfound position makes her a prime target for supernatural factions (vampires, the Fey, mages, etc.) looking to monopolize -- or simply destroy -- her powers. To complicate matters, Palmer learns that someone, most likely a 500-year-old master vampire who happens to be Dracula's older brother, has put a "geis" on her, a magical bond that not only deters any potential suitors but also makes Palmer irrationally attracted to her supernatural subjugator. But when she vows to remove the geis, she finds herself an unwilling pawn in the middle of a dangerous power play... <p>Blending contemporary fantasy, romance, and horror into an appetizing literary amalgam, the crossover appeal of Chance's Cassie Palmer saga will undoubtedly find a more than welcoming audience with fans of authors like Laurell K. Hamilton, Kim Harrison, and Charlaine Harris. Chance's left-of-center sense of humor -- in particular, bastardized Latin one-liners like "stercus accidit" -- makes this relatively lighthearted series a fast-paced and highly entertaining read.-Paul Goat Allen -- <i>Explorations SF/F Reviews</i></p></p><h2>Lift Every Voice: The NAACP and the Making of the Civil Rights Movement</h2><p><b>An epic narrative of the struggle against injustice, hailed as &#x201c;the definitive history of the NAACP&#x201d; by Henry Louis Gates Jr.</b><br><p>A &#x201c;civil rights Hall of Fame&#x201d; (<em>Kirkus</em>) that was published to remarkable praise in conjunction with the NAACP&#x2019;s Centennial Celebration, <em>Lift Every Voice</em> is a momentous history of the struggle for civil rights told through the stories of men and women who fought inescapable racial barriers in the North as well as the South&#x2014;keeping the promise of democracy alive from the earliest days of the twentieth century to the triumphs of the 1950s and 1960s.</p><p>Historian Patricia Sullivan unearths the little-known early decades of the NAACP&#x2019;s activism, telling startling stories of personal bravery, legal brilliance, and political maneuvering by the likes of W.E.B.

Victoria's matchmaking plans were further complicated by the tumultuous international upheavals of the time: revolution and war were in the air, and kings and queens, princes and princesses were vulnerable targets.<br><i>Queen Victoria's Matchmaking</i> travels through the glittering, decadent palaces of Europe from London to Saint Petersburg, weaving in scandals, political machinations and family tensions to enthralling effect. It is at once an intimate portrait of a royal family and an examination of the conflict caused by the marriages the Queen arranged. At the heart of it all is Victoria herself: doting grandmother one moment, determined Queen Empress the next.</p><p><b>Deborah Cadbury </b>is an award-winning documentary producer for the BBC.

Rudolf Steiner speaks about this split in various different ways with a kind of &#x201c;hidden&#x201d; language, making it sometimes difficult to understand the fundamental idea. In this book, Dennis Klocek presents a kind of meditation on many different aspects of color and how we can work with the alchemical principles of Jachin and Boaz&#x2015;the two pillars of Solomon&#x2019;s Temple, representing the red and blue in the blood&#x2015;to understand the Rosicrucian path in terms of color and healing.</p> <p>Using many examples from natural- and spiritual-scientific research into color and the rise of various color theories through history, Klocek zeros in on the real essence of colors and how they relate to us as human beings in our physical body and soul. From Newton to Rudolf Steiner, as well as several centuries of artistic development of color and pigments, we learn to perceive in new ways that can both heal and help us work and play with color in new ways. The author also connects what we learn about color to healing with artistic therapies, homeopathy, and flower essences.</p> <p><i>Colors of the Soul</i> is illustrated in full color, featuring numerous helpful diagrams and examples of art from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century. Like the author&#x2019;s books on physiology, climate, and agriculture, this book brings knowledge and surprising insights to the nature of color, a topic that is integral to our everyday life and development.</p> This book is based on previously unpublished lectures given at Rudolf Steiner College Coros Institute in summer 2010.</p><p><b>Dennis Klocek</b>&nbsp;is a teacher, researcher, artist, gardener, and alchemist.

These factors, sometimes called the Big Five and represented by the acronym OCEAN, are <ul><li>Openness to experience</li><li>Conscientiousness</li><li>Extroversion</li><li>Agreeableness</li><li>Neuroticism</li></ul> How does this Five-Factor Model fit with a Christian understanding of human nature? How does it compare or contrast with the way Jesus lived, taught and counseled? James Beck looks at prominent themes in the teaching and ministry of Jesus and how they relate to the five personality factors. Here is a study of the Christian implications of the new model--a study that will offer fresh insights for students, pastors and therapists alike.</p><p>James R. Beck, Ph.D., is a licensed clinical psychologist and a professor and the chair of the counseling department at Denver Seminary. His six previous books include <em>Helping Worriers</em> (coauthored with David Moore) and <em>The Healing Words of Jesus.</em>"This book is a powerful and encouraging model of how one Christian psychotherapist derives his foundational insights into human personality from Scripture, and especially from the teaching and behavior of Jesus. Here is no simplistic proof-texting but careful exegesis. Along the way, numerous claims of modern psychology are confirmed, while other ones are challenged. Anyone who reads this book and still believes that Christian counseling cannot be thoroughly biblically rooted simply does not understand the Bible, much less Christian counseling!&#x201d;" (Craig Blomberg, professor of New Testament, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"While many authors talk about integrating psychological and theological perspectives on human personality, it is refreshing to see someone succeed. Beck has masterfully blended modern personality psychology with biblical views of human functioning, showing how each is essential for a complete understanding of how humans both are and ought to be. The science of personality can yield valuable insights into the teaching and counseling of Jesus. Conversely, Beck convincingly demonstrates that Jesus is the ultimate authority on human personality. This book is a concrete illustration of how the search for truth regarding human nature requires both revelation and experimentation. Thank you, James Beck, for showing us how to do integration the right way. This is a book to get excited about!&#x201d;" (Robert A. Emmons, professor of Psychology, University of California--Davis)<br><br>"For long years the relationship between psychotherapy and biblical faith has been a hotly debated issue, especially among evangelicals. In this wide-ranging discussion, informed by an impressive command of both theological sources and therapeutic theories, James Beck gives a definitive reply to that question. This is the best example I have come across thus far of how much-mooted integration is to be achieved. It demonstrates that the truths and teachings of Scripture dovetail with the soundest of contemporary counseling approaches. But this book is not for counselors and psychologists only. By no means! Beck&#x2019;s treatment of biblical materials is illuminating and yet down-to-earth. I hope that this lucid work of scholarship will win the appreciative readership it deserves." (Vernon C. Grounds, Chancellor, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"By examining the highly reputed and empirically established five-factor model of personality in light of equally tested teachings of Christ, Beck has done the Christian community a great service. Whether acknowledged or not, he has done the same for psychology." (Peter C. Hill, professor of psychology, Grove City College; editor, Journal of Psychology and Christianity)<br><br>"You may not agree with all of his conclusions. But after reading this book you will have a better understanding of Christ and of yourself--and a new appreciation for the practicality and relevance of God's authoritative Word." (Gary J. Oliver, executive director, The Center for Marriage and Family Studies)<br><br>"A book that should be required reading for all clergy and Christian counselors!" (David G. Benner, professor of psychology, Redeemer College, Ancaster, Ontario, Canada; director, Institute for Psychospiritual Health)</p><h2>The Essence of Photography: Seeing and Creativity</h2><p><p>There is a lot more to photography than simply picking up a camera, pointing it toward something, and tripping the shutter. Achieving a great photograph requires thought and preparation, an understanding of the photographic process, and a firm grasp of how light and composition affect a photo. There must be personal involvement and personal expression. There must be experimentation, with the recognition that only a small percentage of experiments end successfully.<br><br>In this book, best-selling author and world-renowned photographer and teacher Bruce Barnbaum explores these seldom-discussed issues by drawing upon his personal experiences and observations from more than 40 years of photographing and teaching. In addition to photographs, Bruce also uses painting, music, and writing, as well as the sciences and even business, to provide pertinent examples of creative thinking. These examples serve as stepping-stones that will lead you to your own heightened ability to see and be creative.<br><br>Creativity is a topic that is almost wholly ignored in formal education because most instructors think that it cannot be taught or learned. To the contrary, Bruce has proven that photographic seeing and creativity can be taught, learned, and improved. This book expands on the ideas that are central to Bruce's method of teaching photography, which he has used in workshops for the past 41 years.<br><br>Included in the book are in-depth discussions on the following topics:<br><br></p><ul><li>Defining your own unique rhythm and approach as a photographer</li><li>How to translate the scene in front of you to the final photograph</li><li>The differences and similarities between how an amateur and a professional approach photography</li><li>The differences between realism and abstraction, and the possibilities and limitations of each</li><li>Learning to expand your own seeing and creativity through classes, workshops, and associating with other photographers</li><li>Why the rules of composition should be ignored</li><li>How to follow your passion</li><li>When to listen to the critics and when to ignore them</li></ul>The book is richly illustrated with over 90 photographs taken by Bruce as well as other photographers.Seeing and creativity are difficult to teach, but not impossible. This very different, perhaps groundbreaking book is sure to inspire photographers of all skill levels-from beginners to seasoned professionals-to think deeply about the issues involved in creating successful photographs.</p><p>Bruce Barnbaum, of Granite Falls, WA, began photography as a hobbyist in the 1960s, and after five decades, it is still his hobby. Photography has also been his life&#x2019;s work for the past 50 years.<p></p> Bruce&#x2019;s educational background includes Bachelor&#x2019;s and Master&#x2019;s degrees in mathematics from UCLA. After working for several years as a mathematical analyst and computer programmer for missile guidance systems, he abruptly left the field and turned to photography.<p></p> Bruce is recognized as one of the finest darkroom printers on this planet for his exceptional black-and-white work. He understands light to an extent rarely found and combines this understanding with mastery of composition, applying his knowledge to an extraordinarily wide range of subject matter.<p></p> Bruce has authored several books that have become classics. The first edition of The Art of Photography: An Approach to Personal Expression was released in 2010 by Rocky Nook. After having sold over 100,000 copies, it is now in its revised second edition. This book became an instant bestseller and is sure to remain a classic for years to come.<p></p> The Essence of Photography, released in 2015, is now in its second printing. This non-technical book delves deeply into the heart of turning photography from an instrument of recording images to one of making artistic personal statements; progressing from the scene you encountered, to how you feel about the scene you encountered, and then onto how to express that feeling to others.<p></p> Bruce&#x2019;s two Tone Poems books are a collaboration of photography and accompanying music. On musical CDs packaged with each book, pianist Judith Cohen&#x2015;performing solos as well as with other musicians in duets and trios&#x2015;matches the mood of the imagery found in each book with carefully chosen classical music. Book 1 contains 90 black-and-white images; Book 2 delivers another 91 images. These books, which were magnificently printed in Italy, come in large 12&#x2dd;x12&#x2dd; format.<p></p> Bruce&#x2019;s Plateaus and Canyons is an all-color book that displays the wonders of the Colorado Plateau of Northern Arizona and Southern Utah with its varied plateaus, canyons, and unique slit canyons.<p></p> Bruce has been an active environmental advocate for five decades, both independently and through his involvement and leadership with organizations such as the Sierra Club, the National Audubon Society, the Mountain Loop Conservancy, Futurewise, and the North Cascades Conservation Council.<p></p></p><h2>North Star Country: Upstate New York and the Crusade for African American Freedom (New York State History and Culture)</h2><p>The compelling and wide-ranging tale that examines the moral choices made by blacks and whites of New York State to aid the newly freed slaves to secure the promise of freedom. The North Star was both an astronomical reference guiding slaves north to freedom, and a symbol of the moral enterprise that sought to end slavery. This crusade for freedom in the north was born of the religious revivals of the 1820s and 1830s in central and western New York - known as the Burned-Over District, which lit the fires that eventually burst into the conflagration of the Civil War. Milton C. Sernett begins with a history of slavery in upstate New York and ends with John Brown&#39;s execution and burial in the Adirondacks. He includes great abolitionists - among them Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Gerrit Smith, Beriah Green, Jermain Lougen, and Samuel May - and many lesset-known characters who rescued fugitives from slave hunters, maintained safe houses along the Underground Railroad, and otherwise furthered the cause of freedom.</p><p>MILTON C. SERNETT is professor of African American studies and history and adjunct professor of religion at Syracuse University. He is the author of Abolition&#39;s Axe: Beriah Green, Oneida Institute, and the Black Freedom Struggle, also by Syracuse University Press.</p><h2>On the Road with Janis Joplin</h2><p><b>One of <i>Parade</i>'s Top Ten Rock n' Roll Reads</b><br><br> <i>As a road manager and filmmaker, John Byrne Cooke helped run the Janis Joplin show&#x2014;and record it for posterity.

I have been very fortunate in the editors who have chosen to work with me, never more so than in the case of my present editor, Denise Silvestro. Her encouragement, advice, and innovative solutions to every vexing question have improved this book in ways I never imagined possible. Denise&#x2019;s assistant, Allison Janice, labored valiantly over the source notes and performed countless other chores without ever making me feel that any other books or authors needed a minute of her time. Managing editor Michelle Kasper kept the book on schedule. She and many others at Berkley Books and Penguin Random House have made me feel very lucky to be with this publisher.</p><p>Stacy Kreuzmann Quinn and Nancy Reid, of Acid Test Productions, who published <i>Janis Joplin: A Performance Diary</i>, encouraged me to tell my own story of these years and provided helpful suggestions and insights.</p><p>Earl Crabb and David Swift scanned research pages and early drafts of this book into my computer before I knew anything about scanning. Earl has contributed so many hours of computer diagnosis, problem-solving and advice over the course of thirty years that I can never adequately repay him, but I will try my best to channel Albert Grossman and pick up the check anytime we break bread together.</p><p>Many of Janis&#x2019;s friends and mine, among them many of the people who knew Janis best during her years of national and international touring, contributed their insights and knowledge by agreeing to sit down for recorded conversations with me. Excerpts in the book are credited as &#x201c;Author interview with,&#x201d; but these were truly conversations that followed wherever the pathways of memory took us, rather than a prepared list of questions, although I had those too. None of these contributors were more consistently helpful than Sam Andrew, of Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Bob Neuwirth. Dave Getz and Peter Albin, the other surviving members of Big Brother, also deserve special mention.

Memories are fallible, of course. Our impressions of the past are subjective and selective. They summon up what we want it to be as well as what it was. In preparing to write this story I spoke with many people who experienced the same events I did, and many who were present at times and places where I was not.

There they landed and there, for the most part, they stayed, close by the Atlantic shore. In five hours I&#x2019;ve covered what it took the emigrants of the nineteenth century&#x2019;s great westward migration months of peril to travel. Like those earlier travelers, I&#x2019;m casting off the old and hoping to find in California the magic pathway to the rest of my life.</p><p>Go west, young man.</p><p>In my case, it is Albert Grossman, not Horace Greeley, who points the way.</p><p>The southwest wind is roiling the shallow waters off the airport runway, turning them muddy emerald. It has been a cold fall in the East. By comparison, the California air feels springlike as I cross the tarmac to the terminal. The hills that surround the Bay are greened by the rains that return to the coast with autumn. Autumn in the East forces the flora into retreat and quiescence. To an easterner, green hills in November signal rebirth ahead of its time, a resurrection that fills me with hope. The breeze carries the scent of growing things. Mixed with the jet fumes, I can smell salt water, and something more exotic&#x2014;patchouli oil, maybe, or pot.</p><p>Peter Albin greets me at the gate. We have talked on the phone in recent days, to discuss logistics (&#x201c;My flight gets in at&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pick you up and we&#x2019;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;). I know Peter by sight because I saw him, back in June, at the Monterey International Pop Festival, standing his ground at stage right as a member of Big Brother and the Holding Company, the band that knocked the audience back on its collective heel. Peter&#x2019;s feet don&#x2019;t move much when he plays the electric bass. His body sways to the beat, sometimes curling over the instrument to wring from it insistent riffs that propel the songs forward, sometimes standing bolt upright, his back arched, shaking the bass so the notes fly from the stage with that much more force.</p><p>In the airport, face-to-face, Peter is friendly, open, welcoming. He moves with angular looseness and has a lopsided smile. At twenty-three, he&#x2019;s the youngest in the band. In Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I have lived for the past nine years, Peter&#x2019;s shoulder-length hair would earn him derisive shouts of &#x201c;Hahvahd fairy!&#x201d; from the townies, their ducktails rigid with Brylcreem. In SFO, he attracts surreptitious glances from the servicemen emplaning for Vietnam and the businessmen in their suits. It would surprise them to know that Peter is a junior executive, dressed for rock and roll. He is the member of Big Brother who signs the contracts, the one who comes to pick up the guy dispatched from New York by Albert Grossman&#x2014;creator of Peter, Paul and Mary, manager of Bob Dylan and a host of lesser folk luminaries&#x2014;to oversee the band on the road. As the music of the counterculture has evolved from folk to folk-rock&#x2014;the Mamas &amp; the Papas, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Buffalo Springfield&#x2014;to full-bore rock and roll, Albert has kept pace.</p><p>When Peter&#x2019;s car crests the rise where Highway 101 leaves South San Francisco behind and comes in view of the city proper, I see the white houses dancing up and down the hills and I feel at home. San Francisco is my favorite American city. I have been here often over the years, most recently in June, when I landed at SFO as part of D. A. Pennebaker&#x2019;s film crew, on my way to Monterey for the Pop Festival, fired then, as now, with the sense of moving toward the promise of things to come, ready to do my part to make the promise come true.</p><p>I have a family connection to the Bay Area, an uncle who is a professor of botany at UC Berkeley. When I drove across the country for the first time, in the summer after my sophomore year at Harvard, my uncle&#x2019;s Berkeley home was my destination. In recent years, it is music that has brought me often to the cities by the Bay. From the first time I stepped into the Club 47 coffeehouse in Cambridge and heard Joan Baez sing, music has defined my friendships and my life. I discovered bluegrass music and became a member of Cambridge&#x2019;s homegrown bluegrass and old-time band, the Charles River Valley Boys. In the spring of 1963 I drove across the country again, this time with two friends from Cambridge, and we discovered in Berkeley a folk community that was welcoming and familiar.</p><p>In the folk music revival, Berkeley and Cambridge were united by enthusiasm for the traditional roots of American music, black and white, and the innovations that creative players could derive from those themes. Some of my Cambridge friends made the journey to California regularly. A few moved here. The kinship forged on the Cambridge-Berkeley axis was based on sharing the music and shunning competition. We believed ourselves to be quietly superior to what we saw as the more commercially oriented pickers in New York and L.A. Our image of the prototypical New York guitar player was a guy who turned toward the wall when he played his hottest licks, so you couldn&#x2019;t see how he did it.</p><p>Since that first visit to the Berkeley folk scene in 1963, I have come back whenever I can, to play music and smoke dope and drink Jack Daniel&#x2019;s Tennessee whiskey and Rainier Ale&#x2014;Berkeley&#x2019;s preferred boilermaker, known locally as JD and Green Death&#x2014;and to experience the brilliant, preternaturally focused California days that inspire us to throw some bread and cheese and wine into a backpack and take acid and spend the day somewhere on the coast.</p><p>A couple of years ago I moved to California for what I thought would be forever, but it turned out I was chasing the Wrong Girl. This time, I&#x2019;m here to stay. I have left behind the life of a performing musician in the interest of getting serious about the rest of my life. For now, I will help others devote themselves more fully to their music while I handle the money and logistics. I have exchanged my guitar for an attach� case. It contains itineraries, contracts, and the promise of loud music, late nights, and loose women.</p><p>To Peter Albin, I reveal none of the giddy high that the waters of the Bay, the sight of Coit Tower, a glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge, arouse in me. With Peter, I&#x2019;m all business. I&#x2019;m cool. He takes me to a motel on Columbus Avenue, in North Beach. A few years ago, the North Beach coffeehouses were the focus of San Francisco&#x2019;s folk scene, and before that, the home of the Beats. I wonder if any unamplified music survives in the city that has become the wellspring of American rock and roll, but satisfying this curiosity will have to wait. Right now, I&#x2019;ve got to pass inspection by my prospective employers. Peter gives me half an hour to come down from thirty thousand feet, then picks me up again and takes me to meet the band.</p><p>They rehearse in a third-floor loft in a building they call the Warehouse, close by an off-ramp where the Central Freeway dumps traffic into the city streets. When Peter and I enter the...</p></p><h2>Anxious Souls Will Ask...: The Christ-Centered Spirituality of Dietrich Bonhoeffer</h2><p>Foreword by H.

The Journey, Anne has gone public with the wisdom and insight she has shared privately with couples since 1986. This book is a first. It is not just another book on marriage. Anne has given us a guide for creating relationships that reflects God&#39;s original intention for husbands and wives. Marriage! The Journey confronts commonly held myths about marriage with truth. The book shows how God desires to use even the mate&#39;s imperfections to bring each partner into dependency on Christ&#39;s Life and into intimacy with each other. Andy Stanley Senior Pastor Northpoint Community Church Alpharetta, GA Anne Trippe has captured for us the depths of marital intimacy and what Father designed for marriage. What she has written here is not theory. It is well tested through many applications in the lives of those she has counseled over the years. Anne candidly exposes the lies that have kept couples bound in unhappy marriages, but, along with that, unveils the truth that sets them free. This book will be lifesaving for many couples who think there is no hope for their marriage. Tom Grady Founder, SAR Adventures Founder, Grace Ministries International Atlanta, GA It is with great enthusiasm that I recommend Anne Trippe&#39;s book, Marriage! The Journey. Anne offers no behavior modification advice couched in religious language. Her prescription is simple, practical and biblical. With winsome clarity, she points us back to the indwelling life of Christ and shows us how to experience Him as the very life of our marriage. This book is a &#34;must read&#34; for those wanting to know the kind of marriage God intends for us all. Dr. Steve McVey President, Grace Walk Ministries Atlanta, GA Dr. Anne Trippe and her husband, Vinson, have been married since 1962. They have four children and thirteen grandchildren. Anne is a Licensed Counselor and Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist on staff at First Baptist Church of Atlanta. Anne is involved in the training and supervising of the lay counseling program at First Baptist. She developed the successful sixteen-week marriage building course, Journey to Freedom in Marriage, and wrote the book, The Purpose of Trials and Adversity.</p><p></p><h2>Paradise News</h2><p>Paradise, tourist style. It's a very long way from home.<p>Bernard Walsh is in Hawaii on family business, escorting his querulous father to the bedside of a long-forgotten aunt. His mission transports him from quiet obscurity in Rummridge, England, to a lush tropical playground, from cloistered solitude into the unfamiliar company of package tourists: honeymooners; young women looking for Mr. Nice; families nuclear and fissile. But it is the island itself that holds the most astonishing surprises, as an accidental encounter opens up to Bernard possibilities of life, and love, never dreamed of in his normally overcast habitat. <b>Paradise News</b> is an enchanting--and very funny--portrait of the late flowering of an honest man.</p></p><p>David Lodge is the author of twelve novels and a novella, including the Booker Prize finalists <b>Small World</b> and <b>Nice Work</b>.

Charles Armstrong, a Brit, reads expressively at a brisk clip. His characterizations are hit-and-miss. All his women are whiny, and his American accent laughable. On the other hand, he makes particularly memorable the ignorant Irish father and a self-important anthropologist completely devoid of common sense. Y.R.

European exploration, Indian wars, gold booms and busts, presidential visits, frontier shootouts, and the natural beauty of the surrounding Black Hills have all captured the imagination of Americans and foreigners. <i>Deadwood: The Golden Years</i> recreates the town that assimilated all that its geography, gold, natural disasters, and the extremes of human behavior could throw in its way. Deadwood was a microcosm of the American frontier and the gold rush town. This history of Deadwood emphasizes its most volatile period, 1875-1925, with careful scrutiny of before and after.The author, a western historian and foremost raconteur, carefully separates legend from fact and presents them both: the spirit of Deadwood was real. Witty and sympathetic understanding born of a lifetime in the Black Hills and acquaintance with many of the characters who traipse through the pages give this book a comprehensiveness rarely found. It is a lively, reliable, and sometimes irreverent narrative of Deadwood&#x2014;the next best thing to having lived there for the last century.</p><p>Watson Parker is professor emeritus of history at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh and the author of <i>Gold in the Black Hills</i> and <i>Black Hills Ghost Towns.</i></p><h2>Plum Pie</h2><p><i>Plum Pie</i> is perhaps Wodehouse's best-loved short story collection--no surprise as it features a true Wodehouse trifecta--Jeeves, golf, and Blandings Castle.</p><p><b>P.

Christopher Penczak is a true teacher of the mysteries."&#x2015;Rosemary Ellen Guiley, author of <em>The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft &amp; Wicca</em></p> <p>"Journey further down the path of mystery, ministry and magick. <em>The Living Temple of Witchcraft: Part I</em> is a thought-provoking guide and valuable tool for personal transformation. This book will be invaluable resource to teachers, Priests and Priestesses of the Craft."&#x2015;Ellen Dugan, author of <em>Natural Witchery</em> &amp; <em>Garden Witchery</em></p> <p>"To continue and to supplement his <em>Inner Temple of Witchcraft</em>, <em>Outer Temple of Witchcraft</em>, and <em>Temple of Shamanic Witchcraft</em>, Christopher Penczak here looks at the fundamentals of the Craft in terms of Magic, Mystery and Ministry. Christopher describes the material in this volume as "the trunk of the tree;" the tree of the knowledge of his teachings. Much like his others, this is an eminently practical book; a valid teaching tool that will progress you along your chosen path. All such paths need a trustworthy guide. Christopher Penczak is such a guide. He here proves himself experienced and knowledgeable. You may safely place yourself in his hands."&#x2015;Raymond Buckland, author of <em>Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft</em></p> <p>"Christopher Penczak is a sharp writer and a talented Witch. He offers here a book of focus and skill that will be a great help on your path."&#x2015;Deborah Lipp, author of <em>The Elements of Ritual</em> and <em>The Study of Witchcraft</em></p> <p>"What a pleasure and most certainly a privilege it was to keep company with and listen to Christopher Penczak's lessons/workshop/ lectures; his humour is marvellously universal; and better still, funny. I was impressed and the opinion that the good teachers of the Craft have always been at their best when young was once again confirmed. Christopher is a vibrant man with vast knowledge and understanding of the mysteries. He has none of the pomposity which is so apparent in many public Craft speakers."&#x2015;Maxine Sanders, Author of <em>Fire Child</em> and Alexandrian Elder</p> <p>"It is a joy for me to share these comments. I began my training for Initiation when Christopher was not yet two years old. As one of the elder Wiccans around, I have seen a profusion of books being written about Wicca yet only a few authors begin to grasp the depth and wonder of Wicca as a valid Mystery Tradition. Reading Christopher's books and coming to know him as a fellow author and educator, he is, in my opinion, the finest of the new generation of Wiccan educators and authors. Beginning with <em>The Inner Temple of Witchcraft</em> and <em>The Outer Temple of Witchcraft</em>, among his other books, Christopher has prepared the student for this major working of self-discovery and wisdom. In this new two-volume series, he offers the serious student a well-crafted and intelligent path into the Mysteries of Witchcraft. Readers can place themselves safely into Christopher's care, reading this thoughtful, well-constructed text and working with the projects and meditations which allow for guided study. Few books have ever been written capable of guiding a solitary practitioner into the inner mysteries. He takes the student through the initiatory concepts and practices of the seven archetypes which have been known to many generations of wise people in many cultures which, if this work is embraced, will bring the reader into the joys of spiritual wisdom."&#x2015;Rev. Paul Beyerl, Author of <em>The Master Book of Herbalism</em>, <em>The Holy Books of the Devas</em> and founder of The Rowan Tree Church</p> <p>"Christopher Penczak has assembled a comprehensive summary of initiatory and magical techniques from many ancient traditions in this valuable resource book. But he has done more, for he shows the reader, with clarity and precision, how such traditions and textual sources have a thread of spiritual and transformative connection with one another, and how they may be used in new ways in a modern practice of witchcraft and magic. He also allows the student to make conscious choices, rather than dictate any one dogmatic path or tradition, offering multiple ways in which the inner calling to witchcraft can be brought through into the waking mind. In the 21st century, revival witchcraft and paganism emerges into a new phase of maturity, and readers are fortunate to have a new generation of writers whose work comes from dedicated practice and experience rather than from sensationalism and posturing. Christopher's book combines research, integrity, and experience, and gives the student substantial material to explore and practice."&#x2015;R. J. Stewart, musican, composer, and author of more than 40 books including <em>The Living World of Faery</em> and <em>Advanced Magical Arts</em></p> <p>"Christopher Penczak is a gentle priest with lightning bolts at his fingertips. He has power and wisdom balanced within himself and his teachings."&#x2015;Laurie Cabot, author of <em>Power of the Witch</em> and <em>Celebrate the Earth</em></p> <p>"A Witch both traditional and modern, Penczak manages to combine no-nonsense practicality with the underpinnings of a deeper theological exploration."&#x2015;T.

It solves 80% of lifes problems. Sri Kaleshwars vision on Vaastu reveals the hidden aspects of Vaastu for our modern times. He brings clarity and removes the myths, making Vaastu a practical tool for everyonewhether you live in a city or in the country, in a palace or a hut. Vaastu determines whether a place is suitable to live in or not. Although the same nature exists everywhere, each location is different. You need to know if a place is fit to live, if it will bring you happiness. Will a seed sprout there? Vaastu tells you this. All places cannot be temples. All places are not the birthplaces of saints. All places do not bring happiness. Vaastu decides whether or not the land will support you and bring success. As a doctor prescribes healthy food to a patientwhat to eat and not to eatVaastu prescribes the positive and negative qualities of a place.from Victory Through Vaastu. Many people are facing unnecessary problems in their life. They have good hearts. They only want to live their lives very peacefully, but many obstacles are coming, coming, comingmany headaches and worries. They dont know what they are doing wrong. They feel like theyre being punished. Theyre doing their best, but negative strokes keep coming. They have pure hearts and dedication. How come they are failing? Is it fair? Its only the Vaastu. Once they fix it their life will come up very beautifully, blooming as a beautiful flower.from Victory Through Vaastu</p><p>People from around the world have witnessed Swami Kaleshwars divine gifts: hundreds of miracles have been documented; thousands and thousands have experienced healings by him; his books and teachings reveal knowledge never before given to the world; From his Ashram in Penukonda India where he lives with his wife, daughter and family, he travels the globe helping and healing more and more people each year, as well as giving talks on the depth and breadth of the sacred knowledge of India that has been passed down to him. Yet, when asked what he feels is his greatest gift to the world, he simply says, My students. Every soul has the potential to reach the level of a Shirdi Baba or Jesus and contribute amazing things to the world, Swami says. Everybody can do it. Thats my golden statement. Thats my mission. Everybodys equal. What did Jesus Christ say? Who really trusts in himthey will become more powerful than him. That means all his students. Everybodys equal. Swami believes that it is a masters duty to teach the knowledge to the student so he or she can reach this level not to keep them as students or devotees forever. Studentism is a kind of slavery, Swami says. It is his heartfelt desire to create spiritual masters that are greater and more powerful than he is. The only difference between the master and the student is knowledge, says Swami. The master knows certain things that the student does not yet know. If Im eating a mango, its crazy just to say to you, This is so sweet! You must taste the sweetness for yourself. Swami says that you must have that knowledge and that it is his dharma, his duty, to bring the ancient knowledge of the great rishis of India to the modern world. For thousands of years this knowledge has been hidden and protected, taught only to a few. Now is the time for the world to receive the knowledge of the powerful spiritual systems written about in the ancient manuscripts. The knowledge is important and how you use it is important. This is the wisdom that Swami Kaleshwar is giving open-heartedly to the world. He is a spiritual master intent on making more spiritual mastershundreds morewho in turn will have the capacity to make hundreds and thousands more. All of them will be trained to bring enlightenment and healing to mankind during these critical times. According to Swami the current state of spirituality is deeply unfortunate. He believes many saints have ruined spirituality by keeping the real knowledge hidden. He believes that each person is a child of the same God. Swami heartfully advocates that everyone is worthy of this knowledge and it should and must be given to the world. He is changing the way people view a spiritual master. He teaches that you should look at a spiritual master as a friend, a brother, guide and your dearest well-wisher, not as a god. He also disagrees very strongly with masters who say one thing and do another and who tell their students to always follow rigid guidelinessuch as being vegetarian, abstaining from alcohol or sexyet, secretly enjoy these things themselves. He teaches that this is hypocritical. He does teach that dikshas (guidelines and restrictions) are necessary to achieve certain energies while doing a particular spiritual practice. In general, however, Swami does not ask his students to follow stringent lifestyle restrictions. He teaches that it is a crime to kill a persons happiness and argues that this is not an expression of real spirituality. Sri Kaleshwars mission is to change the way spirituality is practicedto bring a new level of spirituality to all mankindone that will bring happiness to every persons heartone that will change the worlds belief system. This is his duty, his dharma. Everything he does is to fulfill this pledge.</p><h2>The Danube Cycleway Volume 1: From the source in the Black Forest to Budapest (Cicerone Guide)</h2><p><p>The first in a two-volume set, this guide describes the first half of a long-distance cycle route that follows the entire course of the Danube, Europe's second longest river.

Everything had to look kosher just in case a member of staff stuck their head round the door who wasn&#x2019;t supposed to.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did that happen? Did anybody see Crane?&#x201d;</p><p>Somers scratched the side of his neck. &#x201c;Nah. At about two in the morning, Meisner called for a priest. That was all part of the plan. Father Brook. He didn&#x2019;t suspect a thing. Just came in, administered the last rites, went home. Soon after that, Henderson showed up and did his little speech.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What little speech?&#x201d;</p><p>Somers came to a halt. He didn&#x2019;t make eye contact very often but did so now, assuming a patrician tone which Gaddis took to be an attempt at impersonating Henderson&#x2019;s cut-glass accent.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;From this point onwards, Edward Crane is effectively dead. I would like to thank you all for your work thus far, but a great deal remains to be done.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>A man pushing a rusty bicycle came towards them on the towpath, ticking past in the dusk.</p><p>&#x201c;We were all there,&#x201d; said Somers. &#x201c;Waldemar, Meisner, Forman. Meisner was so nervous he looked as if he was going to throw up. Waldemar didn&#x2019;t speak much English and still didn&#x2019;t really understand what he&#x2019;d got himself involved in. He was probably just thinking about the money. That&#x2019;s what I was doing. Twenty grand in 1992 was a lot of cash to a twenty-eight-year-old nurse. You any idea what we got paid under the Tories?&#x201d;</p><p>Gaddis didn&#x2019;t respond. He didn&#x2019;t want to have a conversation about underfunded nurses. He wanted to hear the end of the story.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway, at some point Henderson took a checklist out of his coat pocket and ran through it. First, he turned to Meisner and asked him if he&#x2019;d filled out the death certificate. Meisner said he had and produced a ballpoint pen from behind his ear, as if that proved it. I was told to go back down to Crane&#x2019;s room and wrap the body. &#x2018;No need to clean him,&#x2019; Henderson said. For some reason, Waldemar&#x2014;we called him Wally&#x2014;thought this was funny and we all just stood there watching him laugh. Then Henderson tells him to pull himself together and gives him instructions to have a trolley waiting, to take the old man down to the ambulance. I remember Henderson didn&#x2019;t talk to Forman until the rest of us had gone. Don&#x2019;t ask me what he&#x2019;d agreed with her. Probably to tag a random corpse in the mortuary, some tramp from Praed Street with no ID, no history. How else could they have got away with it? They needed a second body.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is useful,&#x201d; Gaddis told him, because he felt that he needed to say something. &#x201c;This is really useful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you get what you pay for, don&#x2019;t you, Professor?&#x201d; Somers produced a smug grin. &#x201c;What was hard is that we had other patients to attend to. It was a normal Monday night. It wasn&#x2019;t as if everything could just grind to a halt because MI6 were in the building. Meisner was the senior doctor, too, so he was always moving back and forth around the hospital. At one point I don&#x2019;t think I saw him for about an hour and a half. Wally had jobs all over the place, me as well. Added to that, I had to try to keep the other nurses out of Crane&#x2019;s room. Just in case they got nosey.&#x201d; The path narrowed beside a barge and the two men were obliged to walk in single file. &#x201c;In the end, everything went like clockwork. Meisner got the certificate done, Crane was wrapped up with a small hole in the fabric he could breathe through, Wally took him down to the ambulance, and the old man was gone by six A.M., out into his new life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His new life,&#x201d; Gaddis muttered. He looked up at the darkening sky and wondered, not for the first time, if he would ever set eyes on Edward Anthony Crane. &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Almost.&#x201d; Somers wiped his nose in the failing light. &#x201c;Eight days later I was going through The Times. Found an obituary for an &#x2018;Edward Crane.&#x2019; Wasn&#x2019;t very long. Tucked down the right-hand side of the page under &#x2018;Lives Remembered,&#x2019; next to some French politician who&#x2019;d fucked up during Suez. Crane was described as a &#x2018;resourceful career diplomat.&#x2019; Born in 1916, educated at Marlborough College, then Trinity, Cambridge. Postings to Moscow, Buenos Aires, Berlin. Never married, no offspring. Died at St. Mary&#x2019;s Hospital, Paddington, after &#x2018;a long battle with cancer.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>A light drizzle was beginning to fall. Gaddis passed a set of lock gates and moved in the direction of a pub. Somers pushed a hand through his hair.</p><p>&#x201c;So that&#x2019;s what happened, Professor,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Edward Crane was a dead man, but he was not a dead man. Edward Crane was alive but he was not alive. That was the situation.&#x201d;</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>The pub was packed.</p><p>Gaddis went to the bar and ordered two pints of Stella Artois, a packet of peanuts, and a double of Famous Grouse. Thanks to Somers, he was down to the loose change in his pockets and had to pay the barman with a debit card. Inside his jacket he found the torn scrap of paper on which he kept his passwords and PIN numbers and punched in the digits while the landlord made a noise through his teeth. With Somers still in the Gents&#x2019;, Gaddis sank the whisky as a single shot, then found a table at the back of the pub where he could watch groups of shivering smokers huddled outside and try to convince himself that he had made the right decision to quit.</p><p>&#x201c;Got you a Stella,&#x201d; he said when Somers came up to the table. For an instant it looked as though he wasn&#x2019;t going to sit down, but Gaddis pushed the pint towards him and said: &#x201c;Peanuts.&#x201d;</p><p>It was just past six o&#x2019;clock. West Hyde on a Tuesday night. Suits, secretaries, suburbia. A jukebox was crooning Andy Williams. Tacked up beside a dartboard in the far corner of the room was an orange poster emblazoned with the words: CURRY NIGHT&#x2014;WEDNESDAY. Gaddis took off his corduroy jacket and looped it over the arm of a neighbouring chair.</p><p>&#x201c;So what happened next?&#x201d;</p><p>He knew that this was the part Somers liked, playing the pivotal role, playing Deep Throat. The nurse&#x2014;the senior nurse, as he would doubtless have insisted&#x2014;produced another of his smug grins and took a thirsty pull on the pint. Something about the warmth of the pub had restored his characteristic complacency; it was as if Somers had reprimanded himself for being too open beside the canal. After all, he was in possession of information that Gaddis wanted. The professor had paid three grand for it. It was gold dust to him.</p><p>&#x201c;What happened next?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Calvin. Next.&#x201d;</p><p>Somers leaned back in his chair. &#x201c;Not much.&#x201d; He seemed to regret this answer and rephrased it, searching for more impact. &#x201c;I watched the ambulance turn past the post office, had a quick smoke, and went back inside. Took the lift up to Crane&#x2019;s room, cleared it out, threw away the bags and catheter, and sent the medical notes down to Patient Records. You could probably check them if you want. Far as the hospital was concerned, a seventy-six-year-old cancer patient had come in suffering from liver failure and died during the night. The sort of thing that happened all the time. It was a new day, a new shift. Time to move on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And Crane?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You never heard another word?&#x201d;</p><p>Somers looked as if he had been asked an idiotic question. That was the trouble with intellectuals. So fucking stupid.</p><p>&#x201c;Why would I hear another word?&#x201d; He took a long draw on the pint and did something with his eyes which made Gaddis want to deck him. &#x201c;Presumably he was given a new identity. Presumably he enjoyed another ten years of happy life and died peacefully in his bed. Who knows?&#x201d;</p><p>T...</p></p><h2>No Eye Can See (Kinship and Courage Series #2)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Jane Kirkpatrick has, almost literally, created her own genre of fiction.

But when a young stagedriver risks all for a Wintu Indian, his life becomes entangled with the turnaround women &#x2013; and together they are changed forever as they discover that <i>No Eye Can See</i> all the good God has in store for those who love Him.</p></p><p><b>Jane Kirkpatrick</b> is the acclaimed author of two nonfiction books and six novels, including the award-winning <i>A Sweetness to the Soul</i> and book one in the Kinship and Courage series: <i>All Together in One Place</i>. She and her husband, Jerry, ranch 160 acres in eastern Oregon.Christian novelist Kirkpatrick follows her well-received All Together in One Place with this rich and engaging sequel that could easily stand alone. She picks up the story of 11 women who have banded together to travel west on the Oregon Trail after losing their menfolk. Kirkpatrick's gifts as a writer are most evident in the surprising complexity of her female characters and in her ability to weave historical details into her story without overwhelming it. The fascinating moments of daily routine on the trail and in California's mining towns fit effortlessly with the plot and include the varying experiences of different races (Chinese and Indian) as well as of men and women. The author brings her heroines alive with full complements of both endearing and frustrating qualities, keeping them on even footing with each other and leaving the reader unsure what they might do next. Kirkpatrick is convincingly insightful about the conflicting emotions these women experience during dramatic life changes, allowing them to struggle, change their minds, make mistakes and start over on different tracks. The novel's chief flaw is that the male characters are far less developed, especially the villainous Zane Randolph. He provides a gripping, driving tension to the novel, but he is too one-dimensionally evil. Even so, this second installment in the Kinship and Courage trilogy satisfies overall as entertainment, as historical fiction and as a thoughtful exploration of human character and community. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The End Of Food</h2><p>Paul Roberts, the best-selling author of <i>The End of Oil</i>, turns his attention to the modern food economy and finds that the system entrusted to meet our most basic need is failing.<br><br> In this carefully researched, vivid narrative, Roberts lays out the stark economic realities behind modern food and shows how our system of making, marketing, and moving what we eat is growing less and less compatible with the billions of consumers that system was built to serve.<br><br> At the heart of <i>The End of Food</i> is a grim paradox: the rise of large-scale food production, though it generates more food more cheaply than at any time in history, has reached a point of dangerously diminishing returns. Our high-volume factory systems are creating new risks for food-borne illness, from E. coli to avian flu. Our high-yield crops and livestock generate grain, vegetables, and meat of declining nutritional quality. While nearly one billion people worldwide are overweight or obese, the same number of people&#x2014;one in every seven of us&#x2014;can&#x2019;t get enough to eat. In some of the hardest-hit regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, the lack of a single nutrient, vitamin A, has left more than five million children permanently blind.<br><br> Meanwhile, the shift to heavily mechanized, chemically intensive farming has so compromised soil and water that it&#x2019;s unclear how long such output can be maintained. And just as we&#x2019;ve begun to understand the limits of our abundance, the burgeoning economies of Asia, with their rising middle classes, are adopting Western-style, meat-heavy diets, putting new demands on global food supplies.<br><br> Comprehensive in scope and full of fresh insights, The End of Food presents a lucid, stark vision of the future. It is a call for us to make crucial decisions to help us survive the demise of food production as we know it.<br><br> Paul Roberts is the author of <i>The End of Oil</i>, which was a finalist for the New York Public Library's Helen Bernstein Book Award in 2005. He has written about resource economics and politics for numerous publications, including the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Harper&#x2019;s Magazine</i>, and <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and lectures frequently on business and environmental issues.</p><p>Paul Roberts is the author of The End of Oil, a finalist for the New York Public Library&#39;s Helen Bernstein Book Award in 2005. He has written about resource economics and politics for numerous publications, including the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, and Rolling Stone, and lectures frequently on business and environmental issues. He lives in Washington State.Paul Roberts critiques the current system of food production, both domestic and international, and it is a scary world. Roberts shows how seemingly disparate problemsfirst-world obesity, third-world hunger, food-borne pathogens, rising fuel costs, pollution, and climate changeare connected and are logical responses to an unsustainable large-scale, hyperefficient food system. William Dufris employs an energetic and lively manner to hold the listener&#39;s interest while maintaining a note of matter-of-factness that adds to the grimness and peril. He is adept at delivering the mix of seriousness and astonishment clearly intended by Roberts. Dufris&#39;s pacing is also entirely appropriate for material that is often complex. A faster pace could leave the listener behind; a slower one could dull the impact of the material.

Nobody knew these babies would grow up and play baseball. Nobody knew Jackie and Hank would meet and become heroes. Jackie Robinson and Hank Greenberg were two very different people. But they both became Major League Baseball players, and they both faced a lot of the same challenges in their lives and careers. For Jackie, it was because of his skin color For Hank, it was because of his religion. On May 17, 1947 these two men met for the first time colliding at first base in a close play. While the crowd urged them to fight, Jackie and Hank chose a different path. This is the story of two men who went on to break the barriers of race and religion in American sports and became baseball legends in the process. Beautiful text by Cathy Goldberg Fishman is paired with sumptuous paintings by Mark Elliott. Generous back matter material includes a photo and prose biography of each man, timelines, quotes, resources to learn more, and a selected bibliography.</p><p>Author Cathy Goldberg Fishman lives in Augusta, Georgia. She has taught elementary school, sold encyclopedias from door-to-door, run a daycare center, and owned a children&#x2019;s bookstore. Currently she splits her time between writing, teaching at a community college, and teaching at her synagogue. She is the author of a number of books for children, including the Sydney Taylor Award Honor Book, <em>On Sukkot and Simchat Torah</em>, illustrated by Melanie Hall. Cathy and her husband, Steven, have two children. Although Cathy does not play baseball, she remembers going with her grandfather to watch the Atlanta Crackers play at Ponce de Leon Park. She now roots for the Atlanta Braves.<br><br>Illustrator Mark Elliott holds a BFA in Illustration from the School of Visual Arts. He has illustrated a number of picture books as well as middle grade and young adult book covers. He is currently working on the artwork for <em>Yukon: Sled Dog</em> by Judith Janda Presnall. His work has been exhibited at the Society of Illustrators and the Art Directors Guild and has appeared in numerous Spectrum Annuals.While the moment when Jackie Robinson and Hank Greenberg met (crashing together at first base in a 1947 game) isn&#x2019;t among the lauded moments in baseball history, Fishman makes a case that there&#x2019;s more to the encounter than meets the eye. This dual biography parallels the racism the two athletes encountered on their paths to greatness, and is reinforced by Elliott&#x2019;s somewhat static paintings that show mirroring scenes from the two men&#x2019;s lives on facing pages. While Robinson had to break the color barrier, that doesn&#x2019;t mean the vitriol Greenberg faced as one of the few Jewish ballplayers was any less daunting. Fishman structures the narrative around swelling and shrinking distances, with the two being born 1,000 miles apart, growing up 2,000 miles apart, and finally squaring off 90 feet apart on the field before their collision closed the gap and &#x201c;nothing separated Jackie and Hank.&#x201d; This emphasis neatly reinforces the men&#x2019;s similarities in both character and life experience. An unusual and welcome new slant on a well-covered era in American sports history. <em>&#x2014; Ian Chipman, Booklist March 2012</em></p><h2>Landmark Essays in Mission and World Christianity</h2><p>This anthology offers an insight into the thinking on the nature of mission and the emergence of world Christianity.

The book includes an informative and interesting comparison of Western and Eastern healing philosophy, focusing on treatment versus prevention. It does not assume that one is right while the other is wrong, but instead suggests that both can be used together to achieve overall good health.Though the concepts being explained are quite complex, the book is very easy to understand. Qigong, or the study of qi, is central to the lessons, as is learning to affect how qi moves through the body. The author explains that &#x201c;traditional Chinese physicians believe that since the body's cells are alive, as long as there is a proper supply of qi, the physical damage can be repaired or even completely rebuilt.&#x201d; The book emphasizes the importance of understanding the theory behind the suggested exercises and the need to make them part of a lifelong practice. There is just enough basic information to get started exploring this path to healing. There are also references for further study, and the book concludes with a very helpful glossary of Chinese terms.Abundant photographs demonstrate the recommended exercises, depicting a model performing each one. Despite being still, black-and-white forms, these images do a remarkable job of illustrating how to move through each activity. The accompanying descriptions are clear and easy to follow, with instructions on how to move the body through the exercise, how to breathe with the movement, and recommendations for the number of repetitions needed to be effective.Those who suffer from arthritis know that it can feel like an endless cycle of pain with little hope for improvement. What is perhaps most remarkable about Pain-Free Joints is that it offers hope for more than just pain management. Though the author warns that these exercises will take diligence and patience, with continued practice sufferers may see improvement, or even a reversal of their condition.

Inspired by their success in delivering a secret message to General George Washington himself, the boys step up to help transport much-needed gunpowder to the patriots and end up in an even more dangerous situation, trying to man one of the first submarines and then, later, attempting a prison break to rescue one of their older brothers.</p><p>Follow these brave young patriots as they follow in their father&#x2019;s footsteps and rely on each other, their considerable courage, and God&#x2019;s providence for guidance and strength.</p></p><p>Ambrose and John Clark are back in their second Revolutionary War adventure. Fresh from delivering a top-secret message to George Washington in Patriots, Redcoats, and Spies (2015), the 14-year-old twins have now been recruited to man the American Turtle, the world&#x2019;s first submersible used in combat, in order to attach explosives to the hull of a British ship. Things are complicated by the fact that Loyalist spies are reporting their every move, and their older brother, Berty, is captured and scheduled to be hanged as a traitor. The story moves at a brisk pace with plenty of musketry and bloodshed, and the technical information about the Turtle&#x2019;s creation is interesting rather than dull; readers hearing of the submarine for the first time will be intrigued. Discussion questions, a list of the historical characters who appear in the series, a glossary, and reproductions of historical letters support the story and make this a novel that could easily be incorporated into a classroom or homeschool lesson. --- Kara Dean (<i>Booklist</i>)</p><h2>Love at First Bark (Rescue Me, 4)</h2><p><p><strong>"This heartstring-tugger is certain to win fans." &#x2015;Publishers Weekly STARRED Review for A New Leash on Love</strong></p><p>Animal portrait painter Mia Chambers and architect Ben Thomas have volunteered at the High Grove Animal Shelter for years, and they share a complicated history.

A fresh new design and beautiful full-color images aid identification. First published in 1981, Succulent Flora has long served as an authoritative guide for academics and lay enthusiasts alike. This third edition takes into account intervening taxonomic advances and the discovery and naming of ever more species.

In this newly revised edition of the classic 1981 text, descriptions include characteristics of species, recent taxonomic advances, and their distribution in Southern Africa on maps of each country. Using an encyclopedic format for eight common families organized by genus and species, plants are illustrated with color photographs in the body of this work.

His first two outings featuring San Antonio PI and part-time English professor Tres Navarre (<i>Big Red Tequila</i>, <i>The Widower's Two Step</i>) scored Shamus, Anthony, and Edgar awards, and <i>The Last King of Texas</i> has been likened to the proverbial sliced bread. In <i>The Devil Went Down to Austin</i>, on the other hand, things stink for Tres Navarre. His paraplegic brother, Garrett, has surreptitiously mortgaged the brothers' Austin ranch to subsidize an Internet startup. One of Garrett's partners, Ruby McBride, has been making nice with a sleazy corporate-takeover maven, Matthew Pe�a, and Garrett's been violently feuding with his other partner and lifelong friend, Jimmy Doebler. As for Jimmy, his day started with his divorce from Ruby and ended with a shot to the head. Worse yet, Jimmy bought it in his Chevy pickup by his lakeside home, just feet away from a ranting, beach-sprawled Garrett.<p> All that remains for Tres to do is exonerate his brother, find the real killer (whose clue-laden e-mails alternate with Tres's narrative, delivering Texas-sized creepiness), save the ranch, and with the help of Maia Lee, a beautiful lawyer from his past, untangle a skein of Doebler family murder, misery, and hurt. Witty, sharp as glass, and plotted as well as it's written, <i>The Devil Went Down to Austin</i> paints a high-tech Texas laced with treachery and tequila before a cranked-up Jimmy Buffett backdrop.

This chronological selection of her most notable work offers a delineation of her life and creative development. Formerly associated with the second generation of the New York School, Notley has become a poet with a completely distinctive voice. Grave of Light is a progression of changing forms and styles&#x2015;an extensive panorama held together explicitly by the shape of the poet's times. Notley's poems challenge their subjects head-on, suffusing language with radiant truth.</p><p>ALICE NOTLEY has published more than twenty collections of poems. Her Mysteries of Small Houses (1998) was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. She has received the Griffin Poetry Prize, the Los Angeles Times Book Award for poetry, and an Academy Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She lives in Paris."Always innovative and occasionally maudlin, the poems in Notley's latest book play haphazardly with figures of sound and speech. Showing the influence of ee cummings and William Carlos Williams, these free-verse poems are written as letters, postcards, and prose-paragraphs. ...In one of the most evocative and representative poems here, "Choosing Styles-1972", Notley suggests both the metaphorical and the emotional territory of her work. As she muses on the process of her poetry...she arrives at her subject: death. Although the ending evokes an uneasy resonance with ee cummings, it also shows Notley's talent for finishing a poem as opposed to merely stopping it."&#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i><p>"Notley developed her own ways of treating feminist thought, high and popular culture, and personal themes. This collection restores to print much of the unavailable work of this underground hero."&#x2015;Publishers Weekly, <i>Best Books of 2006</i></p><p>"Notley's oeuvre is a rich field for exploration, andThe Songs and Stories of the Ghouls is a wonderful place to start."&#x2015;David Blomenberg, <i>Sycamore Review</i></p><p>"Alice Notley is a visionary poet overshadowed by no one. These poems are consistently feminist and anti-war in spirit, yet Notley's merciless honesty ensures they are never predictable."&#x2015;Rae Armantrout, author of Up To Speed</p><p>"This wondrous tome is a calling to a higher purpose, where the poet is a seer and communes with the powers of universe&#x2015;beyond the grave&#x2015;through sinewy imagination, and energetically charged language."&#x2015;Anne Waldman, The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Politics</p><p>"Her work displays a lucid sense of humor and a debt to William Carlos Williams."&#x2015;<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>"This monumental book features selected work by Alice Notley, one of America's most enduring poets. Notley has strengthened and redefined alternative forms to traditional modes of writing. Her poetry is autobiographical but her linguistic and experimental skills carpet the personal with a timeless vision that transforms the deaths of family and loved ones into poetic dimensions of grief and startling revelation. Over the decades, Notley has built a rich body of work that cannot be categorized or contained in a complex poetic community. Her poems sing of commitment and the daring steps it takes to move away from the predetermined forms toward a level of discourse that fills fresh pages with nobility and courage."&#x2015;<i>The Bloomsbury Review</i></p><p>"Notley developed her own ways of treating feminist thought, high and popular culture, and personal themes. This collection restores to print much of the unavailable work of this underground hero."&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly, Best Books of 2006</i></p><p>"The inexhaustible reach and ceaseless invention of Notley's vision make Grave of Light a thrilling testament to her greatest poetic gift: an unwavering faith in poetry's power to change the real."&#x2015;Brian Teare, <i>Boston Journal</i></p></p><h2>Goodbye to Shy: 85 Shybusters That Work!</h2><p><p><b>Say hello to new friends, new business opportunities, new love, and new confidence</b></p> <p>Okay, so you're shy.

In general, nursing homes are scorned healthcare institutions--but it was in these transformed HG homes that Kimberly White discovered a new way of "seeing" people and underwent her own personal transformation. Both HG and White shifted their perspective and mindset based on their adoption of The Arbinger Institute's basic principles.</b><br><br>Without realizing it, we tend to treat people as objects. We see them solely in terms of their usefulness to us. This invites tension and conflict, and changing this mindset is at the heart of the Arbinger Institute's work. This book is a moving true story of an unhappy woman whose life and family were transformed when she began researching how Arbinger's ideas were being implemented in nursing homes. Kimberly White was astonished to discover that those who choose to care for the elderly and ill, earning low pay in a maligned industry, were nevertheless full of satisfaction, compassion and love because of their ability to see their patients as real and true and valuable people. White's research became a personal exploration of how to see the people in her own life as people in that same profound way. When she did, everything in her life and her world changed--and the reader's will too.</p><p><b>Kimberly White</b> is a freelance writer who spent 12 years overpaying on Manhattan rent in order to take her five children to free museums, and recently relocated to a small farm town in Illinois to focus on writing. She is a certified Arbinger presenter and former research assistant to the founder, Terry Warner. Her 9 months of research for this book included dozens of hours working alongside nursing home employees in offices, vans, patient rooms, and kitchens.&#x201c;Readers seeking a different kind of self-help guide will find it a positive perspective filled with practical, game-changing applications to everyday life.&#x201d; <br><b><i>&#x2013;&nbsp;Midwest Book Review</i></b><br> http://www.midwestbookreview.com/bw/sep_18.htm#rc<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Shift</i> is a transformative book&#x2014;a rare view of the defining element of corporate culture, the heart of mankind.

Weaving together his immersive interest in people and history with insights gathered from his own experiences, Stephen Wolfram gives an ennobling look at some of the individuals whose ideas and creations have helped shape our world today.<br><br>From his recollections about working with Richard Feynman to his insights about how Alan Turing's work has unleashed generations of innovation to the true role of Ada Lovelace in the history of computing, Wolfram takes the reader into the minds and lives of great thinkers and creators of the past few centuries and shows how great achievements can arise from dramatically different personalities and life trajectories. <br><br> <b>Contents:</b> <br><br> <i>Preface</i><br> Richard Feynman<br> Kurt G�del<br> Alan Turing<br> John von Neumann<br> George Boole<br> Ada Lovelace<br> Gottfried Leibniz<br> Benoit Mandelbrot<br> Steve Jobs<br> Marvin Minsky<br> Russell Towle<br> Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead<br> Richard Crandall<br> Srinivasa Ramanujan<br> Solomon Golomb<br></p><p>Stephen Wolfram has had a unique trajectory in science, technology and business. Widely known for his discoveries in basic science and his groundbreaking 2002 book <i>A New Kind of Science</i>, he has spent three decades building what is now the Wolfram Language: the knowledge-based computer language that powers Mathematica and Wolfram|Alpha and has contributed to countless inventions and discoveries, as well as to the education of several generations of students. <br><br> Wolfram was born in London and educated at Eton, Oxford and Caltech, earning his PhD in physics in 1979 at the age of 20. After a brief but distinguished academic career, he founded Wolfram Research in 1987 and as CEO has built it into one of the world's most respected and innovative software companies, whose products are relied on by millions of people around the world. <br><br><br><br>One of the most gifted minds of our time explains, through short stories and anecdotes, how individuals fundamentally transform human thought and perspective.

One leaves this read far smarter and far more confident in the future of humans.<br> <b>JUAN ENRIQUEZ, Author of <i>Evolving Ourselves</i> and <i>As the Future Catches You</i></b> <br><br> A remarkable book with flashes of insight that will engage computer scientists, physicists, historians--but also fascinate a broader public as it weaves personal stories into the deep import of how and what they calculated.<br> <b>PETER GALISON, Joseph Pellegrino University Professor, Harvard University, Author of <i>Einstein's Clocks, Poincar�'s Maps</i> &amp; coauthor of <i>Objectivity</i></b> <br><br> How could anyone resist? Stephen Wolfram writes with so much more clarity and eloquence than one could reasonably expect of any groundbreaking scientist, and with so much more humanity and accessible ease than one would ever dare hope for from any genius. I've followed Stephen now with constant admiration for the better part of a lifetime, and I'm thrilled to get his illuminating and tremendously enjoyable essays--on everything from Steve Jobs to his own life--all brought together in one hardcover delight.<br> <b> PICO IYER, Author of <i>The Art of Stillness</i></b> <br><br> Stephen Wolfram is a quirky, groundbreaking genius, destined for the science pantheon. So novel are his seemingly simple ideas that it may take half a century before the public adopts them. In his lively collection of biographical essays, Wolfram takes the measure of his predecessors and peers--filtering their achievements though his unique worldview. A great read and thought-provoking fun.<br> <b>RUDY RUCKER, Author of <i>Infinity of the Mind</i> and <i>The Ware Tetralogy</i></b> <br><br> A gem. Most scientists and engineers do not think of historical figures as interesting people whose life stories are relevant to their current careers. Stephen Wolfram proves that curiosity and a bit of voyeurism can help you think better today and imagine a different future for tomorrow.

Duane Moore first made his appearance in <i>The Last Picture Show</i> and, like his author, he has aged but not lost his vigor or his taste for life.<br><br>Back from a two-week trip to Egypt, Duane finds he cannot readjust to life in Thalia, the small, dusty, West Texas hometown in which he has spent all of his life. In the short time he was away, it seems that everything has changed alarmingly. His office barely has a reason to exist now that his son Dickie is running the company from Wichita Falls, his lifelong friends seem to have suddenly grown old, his familiar hangout, once a good old-fashioned convenience store, has been transformed into an "Asian Wonder Deli," his daughters seem to have taken leave of their senses and moved on to new and strange lives, and his own health is at serious risk.<br> <br>It's as if Duane cannot find any solace or familiarity in Thalia and cannot even bring himself to revisit the house he shared for decades with his late wife, Karla, and their children and grandchildren. He spends his days aimlessly riding his bicycle (already a sign of serious eccentricity in West Texas) and living in his cabin outside town. The more he tries to get back to the rhythm of his old life, the more he realizes that he should have left Thalia long ago&#x2014;indeed everybody he cared for seems to have moved on without him, to new lives or to death.<br> <br>The only consolation is meeting the young, attractive geologist, Annie Cameron, whom Dickie has hired to work out of the Thalia office. Annie is brazenly seductive, yet oddly cold, young enough to be Duane's daughter, or worse, and Duane hasn't a clue how to handle her. He's also in love with his psychiatrist, Honor Carmichael, who after years of rebuffing him, has decided to undertake what she feels is Duane's very necessary sex reeducation, opening him up to some major, life-changing surprises.<br> <br>For the lesson of <i>When the Light Goes</i> is that where there's life, there is indeed hope&#x2014;Duane, widowed, displaced from whatever is left of his own life, suddenly rootless in the middle of his own hometown, and at risk of death from a heart that also doesn't seem to be doing its job, is in the end saved by sex, by love, and by his own compassionate and intense interest in other people and the surprises they reveal.<br> <br>At once realistic and life-loving, often hilariously funny, and always moving, Larry McMurtry has written one of his finest and most compelling novels to date, doing for Duane what he did so triumphantly for Aurora in <i>Terms of Endearment.</i></p><p>Larry McMurtry is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays. He lives in Archer City, Texas.In his now-classic debut novel, <i>The Last Picture Show</i>(1966), McMurtry introduced readers to a dying Texas town called Thalia and a lively teenager named Duane Moore. McMurtry revisited both in his novels <i>Texasville</i> (1987) and <i>Duane's Depressed</i> (1999), rendering Duane as a sort of West Texas equivalent of Updike's Rabbit Angstrom. McMurtry's latest novel begins with Duane, now 65, returning from an overseas sabbatical designed to relieve his grief for his deceased wife. He finds that his life in Thalia has receded; his children have all moved on, his oil company is successful without him, and he is utterly alone. In walks Annie, a young blond and new employee at the company. Annie flirts with Duane but soon reveals that--despite her 27 years--she knows almost nothing about sex. Duane hasn't learned much either but is willing to share his meager education with Annie. McMurtry keeps the sexual play frank--too frank, with descriptions of Duane's impotence falling under the heading of <i>too</i> <i>much information</i> Although Duane is surprised by his late-blooming sexuality, readers won't be, and his prolonged malaise deadens the impact of his self-discovery. Still, it's nice to know what ultimately becomes of old Duane--even if it isn't particularly enthralling. <i>Jerry Eberle</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His keynote lectures and seminars on strategic thinking, achieving peak performance, and tech innovation have been acclaimed in dozens of countries. A frequent contributor to the Wall Street Journal, he is the author of two books, How Life Imitates Chess and Winter is Coming, each of which has been translated into more than a dozen languages. He lives in New York.An entertainingly pugnacious mix of memoir and more general arguments about how we should learn to live with our thinking machines * DAILY TELEGRAPH, Science Books of the Year * This book is prompted by the accident of history that meant Garry Kasparov was the finest chess player in the world at the point at which computers exceeded the ability of humans. It is about chess and programming - but also about the wider implications of artificial intelligence * THE TIMES, Science Books of the Year * At a time when fears about computer intelligence have become &#34;existential&#34;, Kasparov has revisited the experience in a timely, thoughtful memoir. Part page-turning thriller, part meditation on the idea of thinking machines, Deep Thinking is both gripping and measured * Book of the Week, THE WEEK * A book dripping with evangelical zeal * Sunday Business Post * A highly human exploration of artificial intelligence, its exciting possibilities and inherent limits. -- MAX LEVCHIN, cofounder of PayPal and CEO of Affirm From the man at the epi-center of one of the ten defining moments of the 20th century, a fascinating and insightful overview of how computers came to surpass humans at chess, and what it means for mankind. Deeply researched and clearly exposited, it is also a revealing portrait of what it is like to be a real-life John Henry pitted against the steam hammer. -- KEN ROGOFF, author of &#39;This Time is Different&#39; The great Garry Kasparov takes on the key economic issue of our time: how we can thrive as humans in a world of thinking machines. This important and optimistic book explains what we as humans are uniquely qualified to do. Instead or wringing our hands about robots, we should all read this book and embrace the future. -- WALTER ISAACSON, author of &#39;The Innovators&#39; DEEP THINKING is an absorbing, often brilliant book which no chess-lover should miss -- Edward Winter * CHESSHISTORY.COM * Intelligent, absorbing...thoughtful reading for anyone interested in human and machine cognition and a must for chess fans * KIRKUS (starred review) * Garry Kasparov&#39;s perspectives on artificial intelligence are borne of personal experience - and despite that, are optimistic, wise and compelling. It&#39;s one thing for the giants of Silicon Valley to tell us our future is bright; it is another thing to hear it from the man who squared off with the world&#39;s most powerful computer, with the whole world watching, and his very identity at stake. -- CHARLES DUHIGG, author of &#39;Smarter Faster Better&#39; As Kasparov recounts in arresting detail what it felt like to compete cognitively with a machine, he extrapolates his experience into an optimistic perspective on how computerized intelligence can enhance rather than overwhelm human brainpower, and instead of eliminating jobs and opportunities, can actually generate them. * BOOKLIST * An absorbing, page-turning thriller that weaves a personal account of intellectual combat with the wider picture of what it&#39;s like to come up against a powerful corporation that is determined to do whatever it takes to crush opposition. Not just a tale of human vs machine, this is also a story about one man vs The Man. * OBSERVER * The raw emotion of that encounter in New York bursts out of the pages of Kasparov&#39;s gripping story. What is striking, and reassuring, is that far from raging against the machine, Kasparov marvels at the capabilities of computers and is excited by the possibilities for future collaboration.This reads at times like a fast-paced psychological thriller. Chess fans will be engrossed by Kasparov&#39;s tale but the book deserves a far broader readership -- John Thornhill * FINANCIAL TIMES * Fascinating . . . an impressively researched history of AI and the field&#39;s ongoing obsession with chess . . . with enough detail to satisfy chess enthusiasts, while providing a thrilling narrative for the casual reader. Deep Thinking delivers a rare balance of analysis and narrative, weaving commentary about technological progress with an inside look at one of the most important chess matches ever played -- DEMIS HASSABIS * NATURE * A gripping account of an intellectual battle like no other.. For fans, it will be like reading Nelson&#39;s postmatch analysis of Trafalgar . . . Deep Thinking is both a lesson in not panicking prematurely and a warning about knowing who your real opponent is * DAILY TELEGRAPH * Excellent... No scientist or tech entrepreneur could make the positive case for the digital revolution with the passionate conviction that Kasparov brings. Not many tragic heroes live to tell the tale.

As such, he is an entertaining storyteller who is deeply knowledgeable about Chinese culture, both ancient and modern, who brings readers<i> into </i>the journey from standing at the edge of the trash pit that used to be Tu Mu's grave to sitting in Han Shan's cave where the Buddhist hermit "Butterfly Woman" serves him tea.</p><p>Illustrated with over one hundred photographs and two hundred poems, <i>Finding Them Gone </i>combines the love of travel with an irrepressible exuberance for poetry. As Porter writes: "The graves of the poets I'd been visiting were so different. Some were simple, some palatial, some had been plowed under by farmers, and others had been reduced to trash pits. Their poems, though, had survived... Poetry is transcendent. We carry it in our hearts and find it there when we have forgotten everything else."</p><p></p><p><b>In praise of Bill Porter/Red Pine:</b></p><p>"In the travel writing that has made him so popular in China, Porter's tone is not reverential but explanatory, and filled with luminous asides...

The daily entries themselves fit squarely in the travelogue genre, seamlessly combining the details of his routes and encounters with the poets&#x2019; biographies, Chinese histories, and a generous helping of the poetry itself. Porter&#x2019;s knowledge of the subject and his curation of the poems make this book well worth reading for travelers and poetry readers alike.

He will discuss the implications of these methods for how we understand the nature of the gospels and how we can read them today. The chapters will sketch the portrait of Jesus that emerges from each gospel, and then examine the &#x201c;canonical&#x201d; view of Jesus by comparing and contrasting these pictures, as well as the ones that emerge from the non-canonical gospels and from the modern quest for the historical Jesus.

S. Naipaul traces the unlikely career of Ganesh Ramsumair, a failed schoolteacher and impecunious village masseur who in time becomes a revered mystic, a thriving entrepreneur, and the most beloved politician in Trinidad. To understand a little better, one has to realize that in the 1940s masseurs were the island&#x2019;s medical practitioners of choice. As one character observes, &#x201c;I know the sort of doctors they have in Trinidad. They think nothing of killing two, three people before breakfast.&#x201d;<br><br>Ganesh&#x2019;s ascent is variously aided and impeded by a Dickensian cast of rogues and eccentrics.

There&#x2019;s the aunt known as The Great Belcher. There are patients pursued by malign clouds or afflicted with an amorous fascination with bicycles.

For over 30 years woodworkers have turned to Fine Woodworking magazine, not only for the wide variety of projects offered, but because the designs offer a level of refinement and sophistication not found in other magazine projects. A signature feature of Fine Woodworking project articles is detailed exploded drawings. Some of these plans are works of art in themselves and reward careful study with insights into the basis of good furniture design. For the many woodworkers who come from engineering and other technical disciplines, these plans are worth the price of the book alone.<br>This book collects the furniture and accessory articles that contain exploded drawings from the last 15 years of Fine Woodworking. It is organized by type of furniture (tables, beds, case pieces, etc.). The book contains approximately 60-65 projects. Because there is such a wide variety of styles, projects types, and skill levels, it should appeal to a wide range of woodworkers.</p><p><i>Fine Woodworking </i>has been publishing the best woodworking information for small shop woodworkers since 1975.</p><h2>Absolute Zero: Misadventures From A Broad (Val Fremden Midlife Mysteries)</h2><p><b>A Midlife Meltdown...with a Side of Fries.</b> Val&#x2019;s long-suffering life as a patient daughter, dutiful wife and reliable workhorse has turned her into a snarky, miserable nag.

Now <i>Compound Fractures</i> provides a riveting last chapter to the series.</b><br><br>Nothing is as it seems to Alan, as unexpected threats and intimate betrayals force him to revisit a cruel ethical dilemma that turned his life upside down as a young psychologist. He has to judge whether the people reentering his life after long absences are friends or foes. He has to make sense of echoes of distant tragedies while he decides if there is anyone he can really trust. And as the clock ticks down, he must solve a deadly mystery in Eldorado Springs that has been brewing for more than a decade....</p><p><b>Stephen White&nbsp;</b>is a clinical psychologist and the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the Alan Gregory novels. He lives in Colorado.<b>Prologue</b><br><br>Doctor Lila<br><br>One session stood out. It was our second. I have replayed the session in my head at least ten times. It was when my perspective changed. The day I got suspicious. On occasion I went back over it to see if there was a nuance I missed. Other times the loop replayed itself, an earworm, a melody my memory couldn&#x2019;t cut loose.<br><br>It&#x2019;s not in my personality to recall moments of assurance with much clarity. What I tend to recall vividly are my doubts and my fears. That therapy loop earned the replays because it was the session when my doubts and my fears began to crystallize, when I went from thinking that I might be in over my therapeutic head to wondering what the hell I might have gotten myself into with Dr. Alan Gregory.<br><br>Or as I called him, my patient.<br>My name is Delilah Mary Travis. My friends call me Lila.<br><br>Most of my patients call me Dr. Travis, or Delilah.<br><br>Alan Gregory called me Lila. But we weren&#x2019;t friends.<br><br>It was the third week of January. The session had been fitful. I felt no rhythm in his words.<br><br>As the end of our time approached I said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what happened that morning. The day of the fire. The morning of the shooting. Moment by moment. You may think I know. You may wish I knew. You may want to proceed as though I know what you need me to know. But I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t reply. That happened frequently with us.<br><br>During Alan&#x2019;s previous visit I&#x2019;d asked him why he&#x2019;d picked me to be his therapist. He said it was because he wanted a therapist he didn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;he knew almost everybody in Boulder&#x2014;and because someone he trusted had once said good things about my work. I&#x2019;d asked him why he didn&#x2019;t go to Denver; there had to be therapists there he didn&#x2019;t know. He said it was too much for him then. An almost three-hour round-trip? He said he couldn&#x2019;t do it.<br><br>I began to think he&#x2019;d been less than honest. I began to believe he chose me because I was inexperienced. He thought he could manipulate me.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;I imagine it will be tender for you, sharing the story. But at some point you will need to tell me those details.&#x201d;<br><br>He stood. His timing was impeccable; he rose within seconds of the precise forty-five-minute mark. As a therapist he had sat through a million forty-five-minute hours. After the first few thousand or so he&#x2019;d undoubtedly internalized the session interval.<br><br>I had not. My hours in the consultation chair were still in high triple-digits. The clock I relied upon was digital. It was not visible from his seat.<br><br>&#x201c;Who does, Lila?&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Know? What happened, I mean.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Who knows? You&#x2019;re going existential about that? You were there, I wasn&#x2019;t. If I had been there I would know what the hell happened.</i><br><br>I kept the rant to myself. I said, &#x201c;Are you unsure what happened that day?&#x201d;<br><br><i>No dissociation, please. I don&#x2019;t have the chops for fugue. Not your fugue. </i><br><br>His face adjusted into an expression I couldn&#x2019;t interpret. He had a few of those. Then he said, &#x201c;Am I &#x2018;sure&#x2019;? A lot of certainty is squeezed into that syllable. Certainty is elusive for me. Death? Certain. Everything else? Uncertain.&#x201d;<br><br><i>God.</i><br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s part of what happened that morning that you don&#x2019;t know. That maybe no one else knows.&#x201d; He took a deep breath. &#x201c;My wife was in my office to caution me about a development in a case she was working. When she came to see me she didn&#x2019;t understand the implications of what she had learned. She thought she did, but she did not. She was being generous, maybe loving&#x2014;I go back and forth about that&#x2014;by warning me about legal action that was coming against someone I know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Legal action?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Taking that person into custody. For questioning. Or arrest. Like that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I said. Why I thanked him I did not know.<br><br>&#x201c;I told her that if she were to start arresting people she would have to begin by arresting me.&#x201d;<br><br>I was disbelieving. I&#x2019;m sure I looked it. I said, &#x201c;You?&#x201d;<br><br>He said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s complicated. This may help: After Lauren told me what she was about to do, I knew the time had arrived to reveal some secrets I&#x2019;d been keeping from her. I did that&#x2014;I revealed some things I had done.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Things?&#x201d; <i>Jesus</i>.<br><br>&#x201c;Acts.&#x201d;<br><br><i>That sure clears things up</i>. I said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re being vague.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Intentionally. I am revealing I have secrets, but I am not revealing those secrets.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Trust?&#x201d; I said. Not exactly a therapeutic reach on my part. It was like a meteorologist forecasting rain seconds after she opens her umbrella.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Lauren recognized the implications of what I told her. I knew she would, but I had hoped that my admission might alter the tilt of her heart. In my favor.&#x201d;<br><br>To him, his failure to trust me required no exploration. I felt it as a wound.<br><br>&#x201c;I was wrong,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Lauren was angry. Not understanding. All that my revelation changed for her that morning was her thinking about whom to arrest.&#x201d;<br><br>Alan Gregory was one of those people who confused me when he told me things intended to alleviate my confusion. By then that wasn&#x2019;t news for me.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;She was going to arrest you? When she was shot?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not at the beginning of her visit but, yes, by the end. When she was shot.&#x201d;<br><br>His shoulders fell. Some amount of tension disappeared from his temples and his jaw. He seemed relieved to have breached this wall with me. We made brief eye contact. The intimacy of it all stunned me. Part of me melted with his glance, as though for that instant alone our arteries shared the same pumping heart.<br><br>He shook his head, as though he were as amazed as I was. His breath was shallow. &#x201c;That morning? The fire up the street? Don&#x2019;t forget the fire.&#x201d;<br><br>My breathing was shallow, too. The mirroring was not intentional. No, I had not forgotten the fire.<br><br>In a way that I don&#x2019;t think I had ever felt before in my time as a therapist, I was aware that a patient was sharing a dangerous secret with me. Not just a sensitive truth&#x2014;that&#x2019;s routine&#x2014;but a dangerous one. Dangerous for him. And possibly dangerous for me.<br><br>Alan Gregory woke to foreboding every morning of his life. To help him I would need to understand his foreboding. Perhaps even to feel it.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Could you please sit back down, Alan?&#x201d; If he considered me a peer he wouldn&#x2019;t put me in the position I was in. I knew that. I didn&#x2019;t like it.<br><br>&#x201c;Our time is up,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>I swallowed a sigh. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my call. This is my office. I am your therapist.&#x201d; I shouldn&#x2019;t have had to remind him of that. We&#x2019;d work on that issue later. The list of what we would work on later was becoming unwieldy.<br><br>He nodded. But he remained standing. He seemed more paralyzed than defiant.<br><br>&#x201c;Your wife was about to have you arrested for what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Something serious,&#x201d; Alan said. &#x201c;A felony. I can&#x2019;t discuss it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br><br>He sat down. &#x201c;I will tell you what I told Lauren that morning: my caution has to do with clean hands.&#x201d; He looked at his hands as though he couldn&#x2019;t not look at his hands.<br><br>With monumental self-control I managed not to look at my hands. I was aware that his wife was shot not too many moments after he told her whatever he told her that morning. Apparently about clean hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Yours?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Your clean hands?&#x201d;<br><br>He stood back up. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Yours.&#x201d;<br><br>That did it. I looked at my hands. I said, &#x201c;Sit, please.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t. Shit. &#x201c;She had a reason to arrest you? The felony?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Definitely.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You say &#x2018;definitely&#x2019; yet you continue to be vague. You seem to be admitting . . . what, guilt? Yes? Are we talking about trust again? Right now? Between you and me?&#x201d;<br><br>Air escaped his nostrils in a little huff. &#x201c;Guilt? No question. Right and wrong. Morality? That&#x2019;s murky. Between us? Of course it&#x2019;s about trust.&#x201d;<br><br>He paused. I look back now and I wonder about that pause. I think he was telling me something. But I was missing it.<br><br>He tried to explain. &#x201c;Trust is not only an issue between you and me. It was there between my wife and me. Maybe it is there between my friend&#x2014;or friends&#x2014;and me. There is a lot on the line here beyond my mental health. Culpability. Survival. Freedom. All of those.&#x201d;<br><br>Before I could acknowledge that gravity, he refocused on the mundane. He said, &#x201c;We need to talk about your notes. Session notes, process notes, whatever. And supervision.&#x201d;<br><br>What? &#x201c;Please sit. If you don&#x2019;t I am going to have to stand.&#x201d; He sat. I said, &#x201c;Thank you. What about supervision? What about my notes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you being supervised on this case?&#x201d;<br><br>I had never before been asked that question. Few patients know that supervision&#x2014;oversight of a treatment by a senior practitioner&#x2014;exists as an option for their therapist. But Alan Gregory knew. He was one of those senior practitioners. In Boulder he was a supervisor.<br><br>&#x201c;This therapy?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;With you?&#x201d; He nodded. &#x201c;No. I am not being supervised.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you change your mind&#x2014;about supervision&#x2014;will you agree to inform me? I can&#x2019;t have what I tell you leave this room. Not even to a supervisor. Clean hands?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s irregular,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You know that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s essential. Without that assurance, I can&#x2019;t proceed. Won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I need to think about it. We can discuss it next time. What about my notes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I would like you to make them sparse,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Short? Or, or lacking detail? What kind of sparse?&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded. Then he shook his head.<br><br>I made a <i>so WTF</i> face. If I&#x2019;d had a supervisor she would have been directing me to continue to work on maintaining a therapeutic expression. They all did.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;Lacking content. No names. No facts. No he-said, I-said. Process? Go to town. Whatever&#x2019;s helpful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t show my clinical notes to anyone, Alan. Ever. You don&#x2019;t have to worry.&#x201d;<br><br>His eyes were dismissive. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be here if I thought you would. I am concerned about people who would look at them without your consent.&#x201d;<br><br>I felt a chill. <i>Huh?</i> I looked at my hands again.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;You may not have experience with those people. I do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said. With another patient, I would not have admitted that. Alan Gregory was not another patient.<br><br>&#x201c;Those people may know that I am coming to see you for therapy,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>It is typically no more a presence in my body than my liver, but my heart suddenly became an entity in my chest. <i>Bump bump. Bump bump.</i><br><br>I began to question things I should have questioned sooner. My mind reassembled fragments and pieces he had allowed to leak out along the way.<br><br><i>A wildfire. Arrest. A gun. Shots in the back. A witness. His partner. A felony. A little boy. Trust. A leg wound. A wife in ICU. A cabbist. </i><br><br><i>Oh shit. And . . . holy shit. The felony. Trust. Guilt?</i> I realized what he was admitting to me. I began to speak. My breath caught in my throat. I tried again.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;You had a motive? That morning? To shoot your wife, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you choose to stop treating me, I understand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I asked you a question,&#x201d; I said.<br><br><i>Bump bump.

But many Christians have difficulty comprehending God&#39;s pain, especially God&#39;s pain in the death of Christ. Is it atonement or child abuse? To speak of God in pain, says Barbara Brown Taylor, is not only to address the biblical stories of Christ&#39;s suffering and death but also to proclaim the God who is present in our pain. This volume of teaching sermons on suffering presents different approaches to the problem of God in pain. In each sermon, Taylor speaks with sensitivity and profound insight as she addresses pain both its human and divine impact.</p><p>Butman Professor of Religion, Piedmont College, and Adjunct Professor of Christian Spirituality, Columbia Theological Seminary</p><h2>Snake Oil, Hustlers and Hambones: The American Medicine Show</h2><p>Long before television and radio commercials beckoned to potential buyers, the medicine show provided free entertainment and promised cures for everything from corns to cancer. Combining elements of the circus, theater, vaudeville, and good old-fashioned entrepreneurship, the showmen of the American medicine show sold tonics, ointments, pills, extracts and a host of other &#34;wonder-cures,&#34; guaranteed to &#34;cure what ails you.&#34; While the cures were seldom miraculous, the medicine show was an important part of American culture and of performance history. Harry Houdini, Buster Keaton, and P.T. Barnum all took a turn upon the medicine show stage. This study of the medicine show phenomenon surveys nineteenth century popular entertainment and provides insight into the ways in which show business, advertising, and medicine manufacture developed in concert. The colorful world of the medicine show, with its Wild West shows, pie-eating contests, clowns, and menageries, is fully explored. Photographs of performers and of the fascinating handbills and posters used to promote the medicine show are included.</p><p>Ann Anderson is a freelance writer, teacher, actor and director.

The escalating war in Vietnam, the riots during the Democratic Convention, and the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr.&nbsp;and Robert Kennedy left a scar on the national consciousness. But one great battle that took place during this time is barely recalled. The nomination of Abe Fortas for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court launched an all-out cultural war that would determine the course of major court cases for years to come. Award-winning judicial journalist and Supreme Court reporter<i>&nbsp;</i>Michael Bobelian brings us right into the halls where this fierce battle raged, pitting Lyndon Johnson and the Democratic Party against Richard Nixon and the GOP in a fight that ended in&nbsp;the defamation of Fortas, the first Jew ever nominated for the highest judicial office. Written in vivid detail, the narrative unfolds in a series of dramatic vignettes, from the landmark ruling of Brown vs. Board of Education to the chaos on the floor of the Democratic Convention.

From the Psalms to traditional Marian prayers to the Lord's Prayer to Amen, the prayers explored in <i>The Words We Pray</i> are gifts from the past that can greatly benefit our spiritual life today.</p></p><p>Amy Welborn is the general editor of Loyola Classics, a series of new editions of the some of the most distinguished Catholic novels of the twentieth century. She is the author of <i>The Words We Pray, Loyola Kids Book of Heroes, Loyola Kids Book of Saints</i> (Loyla Press), <i>De-Coding Da Vinci</i>, <i>Wish You Were Here </i>(Image Books)&nbsp;and the <i>Proove It!</i> series of apologetics books for youth (Our Sunday Visitor). Amy and her family reside in Birmingham, Alabama.This book will be useful to non-Catholics who&#x2019;ve ever wondered about the difference between a Hail Mary and the Salve Regina, as well as Catholics who would like to delve into the significance of some of the Church&#x2019;s most important prayers. Welborn, author of several books for Catholic youth, writes that as a young adult she was "a bit of a prayer snob," finding comfort in extemporaneous personal prayers but not the rote, memorized historic prayers of the Catholic tradition. Her feelings changed around age 30, when she discovered the joys of praying the rosary and realized that there are times when our own words simply aren&#x2019;t enough, and we must rely upon timeless prayers that connect us to something outside our own experience. Here, she presents and analyzes some of the Church&#x2019;s most famous prayers, "worn and prayed by millions," including the sign of the cross, the Our Father (the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer), the Hail Mary, the creeds, the Act of Contrition, the Jesus Prayer, the Anima Christi, the prayers of Saint Francis and others. Welborn does a fine job of drawing on her own experience as she unpacks these ancient prayers, making them accessible and beautiful to modern Catholics.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The late fall sunshine that had warmed the morning was gone now and the tavern was almost cold. Behind the tall oak counter washing pewter mugs was a woman, pretty, plump, clean, her soft brown hair caught in a white muslin cap, She hummed as she worked, smiling now and then and showing a dimple in one cheek.<br><br>The side door, not the one for patrons, opened and in a gust of cold, wet wind a girl slipped into the room, pausing for a moment until her eyes adjusted to the light. The barmaid looked up and, with a frown and a little click of disgust, hurried forward.<br><br>"Leah, you look worse every time I see you. Sit down here while I heat a toddy for you," the plump woman said as she pushed the shivering girl into a chair and went to set the poker in the fire, all the while surreptitiously studying her younger sister. If possible, Leah had lost weight. Her unfleshed bones seemed to poke through her dirty, mended dress; her eyes were sunken, the skin under them blue, her nose sunburned and peeling. There were three bloody scratches running the length of one side of her face: and a long bluish-green bruise on the other side.<br><br>"He give you that?" the barmaid asked in disgust as she jabbed the hot poker into the mug of flip.<br><br>Leah merely shrugged and eagerly put her hands out toward the hot beer and molasses drink.<br><br>"He give any reason for hittin' you?"<br><br>"No more 'n usual," Leah said after drinking hag the contents of the mug and leaning back in the chair.<br><br>"Leah, why don't you -- ?"<br><br>Leah opened her eyes and gave her sister a hard look. "Don't start on me again, Bess," she warned. "We've been through this before. You do what you must and I'll take care of me and the kids."<br><br>Bess stiffened for just a moment before turning away. "Layin' on my back for a few clean gentlemen is a lot easier 'n what you have to do."<br><br>Leah didn't even wince at Bess's crudity. They'd had this argument too many times before for her to be shocked. Two years ago, Bess had had her fill of their crazy father who beat them constantly because "women were born in sin." The older girl had left their poor backwater farm to find herself a job, and, on the side, she was "friendly" to a few men. Leah, of course, had been beaten for Bess's sins. Now, Bess was always trying to get Leah to leave their father's shack of a house. But Leah remained to care for her six younger brothers and sisters. She plowed, planted, harvested, cooked, repaired the house, and, most of all, she protected the little ones from their father's wrath.<br><br>"Look at you!" Bess said. "You look forty-five years old and you're, what? Twenty-two now?"<br><br>"I think so," Leah said tiredly. It was the first time she'd sat down all day and the warm drink was relaxing her. "Do you have any clothes for me?" she whispered lazily.<br><br>Bess started to complain again, but instead she went behind the counter and reached for cold ham, bread, and mustard. As she set a plate on the table beside Leah, she took a seat across from her. Out of the comer of her eye she saw Leah hesitate before touching the food. "You even consider not eatin' that and takin' it back to them kids and I'll cram it down your throat myself."<br><br>Leah gave a little quirk of a smile and tore into the food with both hands. Her mouth full, hey eyes downcast, she said, as if the answer meant nothing to her, "Have you seen him lately?"<br><br>Bess gave the top of her sister's dirty head a sharp took. "You're not still thinkin'..." she began but stopped and looked back at the fire. A flash of lightning lit the tavern.<br><br>Poor Leah, Bess thought. In many ways Leah was like their father, as stubborn and hardheaded as a piece of stone. Bess could walk away and leave the little ones, but to Leah family was everything, even if a lunatic, rampaging old man was part of bet family. After their mother died, Leah had decided that she was going to take care of the kids until the last one was old enough to leave. No matter what happened, or what was done to her, she refused to leave.<br><br>And just as Leah remained with her father, she stubbornly clung to a dream. The dream wasn't the one Bess had always wanted: food, shelter, and warmth. Leah's dream was one she could never attain. Leah fantasized about one Mr. Wesley Stanford.<br><br>When Leah was a girl, Mr. Stanford had come to their hovel, asked her a few questions, and, in gratitude for her answers, he'd kissed her cheek and given her a twenty-dollar gold piece. When Leah had told Bess of the incident, there'd been stars in the young girl's eyes. Bess had immediately wanted to spend the gold on new dresses, but Leah had gone into a rage, screaming that the coin was from <i>her</i> Wesley and that she loved him and he loved her and when she grew up she was going to marry him.<br><br>At the time, Bess's only thought had been of that shiny gold coin hidden somewhere, unspent, all its glory wasted. She began to wish this Wesley had given Leah a bunch of flowers. She tried to forget about that coin, but sometimes she'd see Leah, plow harness about her shoulders, stop and stare into space. "What you thinkin' about?" Bess would ask, and Leah would say, "Him." Bess would groan and turn away. There was no need for Leah to say who <i>him</i> was.<br><br>Years later, Bess decided she could take no more of her father's hideous temper and the constant work, so she left the farm and took a job across the river as a barmaid. Elijah Simmons had disowned his eldest daughter and had forbidden her to visit the farm or see her siblings. But during the last two years, Leah had managed to slip away a few times to visit her sister and get the clothes Bess collected for her. The townspeople wanted to help the desperately poor Simmons family, but Elijah refused to allow his family to accept charity.<br><br>On her first visit to the tavern, Leah had asked after Wesley Stanford. At the time, Bess had been enthralled with having met all the rich plantation owners, and Wesley and his brother Travis were the wealthiest. Bess had talked for thirty minutes about how handsome Wes was, what a considerate man he was, how often he visited the tavern -- and how happy Leah would be when they were married. To Bess, it'd been like the creating of a fairy tale, something to pass the cold winter evenings, and she thought Leah had seen it that way too. But a few months ago, with a laugh, Bess had told Leah that Wes had become engaged to a beautiful young lady named Kimberly Shaw. "Now who are you going to love?" Bess laughed before she saw Leah's white face. Under the bruises and dirt Leah looked as if her blood were draining away.<br><br>"Leah! You can't be serious about a man like Wesley. He's rich, <i>very</i> rich and he wouldn't let a couple of...of, well a 'lady' like me and a scrawny, filthy thing like you in his second-best parlor. This Miss Shaw is from his own class."<br><br>f0 <br><br>Quietly, Leah slipped out of her chair and headed for the door.<br><br>Bess grabbed her arm. "It was just a dream, didn't you realize that?" She paused. "But Wesley has a third gardener that just might be interested in a woman from...from our side of the river."<br><br>Leah didn't answer, but, still pale, she left the tavern, and the next time she visited, she acted as if she'd never heard that Wesley Stanford was engaged. She asked Bess for more stories about Wesley. This time Bess was reluctant, so she again tried to tell her of the engagement. Leah gave her sister such a chilling look that Bess turned away. For all Leah's look of frailty, there were times when she could be imposing.<br><br>Since then Bess hadn't tried to argue with her, and every visit she lifelessly recounted Wes's last time in the tavern. She didn't mention that he was in there more often now because the tavern was on the road between his house and the Shaws'.<br><br>Now Leah leaned back in the chair, slipped her hand into her much-mended pocket, and clutched the gold piece Wesley had given her years ago. Over the years she'd rubbed it so often it was completely smooth. There'd been many nights when the pain from one of her father's beatings had kept her awake and she'd sat on the straw tick rubbing the coin and remembering every second of the time she'd spent with Wesley Stanford. He'd kissed her cheek, and to her knowledge that was the one and only kiss she'd ever received. Sometimes Bess talked about him as if he thought of himself as a god, better than everyone else, but Leah knew how kind he could be, how he could kiss a skinny, dirty little girl he'd never seen before and reward her lavishly. Vain, arrogant men didn't do such things. Bess didn't know him as Leah did. Someday, she thought, she'd see Wesley again and he'd see the love in her eyes and -- .<br><br>"Leah!" Bess half shouted. "Don't fall asleep. The old man will miss you before long. You have to get back."<br><br>"I know. It's just so nice and warm here."<br><br>"You could stay all the time if --."<br><br>Leah stood, cutting off Bess's words. "Thanks for everything, Bess, and I'll see you again next month. We wouldn't be able to make it if it wasn't for you and your --."<br><br>The heavy front door flew open and a man entered, his body filling the opening, pushing the door shut behind him.<br><br>"Oh Lord," Bess gasped, paralyzed for a moment before grinning and moving toward the man. "Awful wet for anybody to be out, Mr. Stanford. Here, let me help you with that," she said, taking his coat from his shoulders and glancing toward Leah, who stood stock-still, gaping.<br><br>He hasn't changed much, Leah thought. He was taller, even more muscular than she remembered, and more handsome. His thick dark hair curled damply about his neck and there were drops of water on his lashes, making his eyes look even darker, even more intense. Bess was standing on her toes and using her hand to brush water from his dark green wool jacket. Buckskin pants hugged his big, hard thighs while tall boots encased his feet and calves.<br><br>"I wasn't sure you'd be open. Doesn't Ben ever give you the night off?" he asked Bess, referring to her boss.<br><br>"Only when he's sure I'll put the night to good use. Ain't nobody around to spend this evenin' with so I might as well tend bar," she teased. "Now you sit down and let me get you somethin' hot to drink."<br><br>Bess began ushering Wesley Stanford toward a tall, sided booth, trying to keep his back to Leah, who still stood in the middle of the room, her eyes wide.<br><br>With a chuckle, Wes disengaged himself from her pushing hands. "What are you trying to do to me, Bess?" It was then he saw Leah, and Bess saw the brief flicker in his eyes. He was judging her as a man looks at a woman and as to where she belonged on the social ladder. He obviously found her wanting in both aspects. "Who's your...pretty friend, Bess?"<br><br>Manners, Bess thought. Those people must be taught manners from the cradle. "This is my sister, Leah," Bess said tightly. "Leah, you best be gettin' home."<br><br>'It's early yet," Leah said, stepping forward into the light; Bess looked at her sister as a stranger would and saw poverty and hardship hanging over Leah like a black cloud. But Leah seemed oblivious to her appearance. Her eyes were fixed glassily on Wesley, who was beginning to look at her in speculation.<br><br>"Perhaps you two ladies will join me in a glass of ale."<br><br>Bess put herself between Leah and Wes. Leah, in her innocence, was giving Wes looks that usually only a seasoned prostitute could produce. "I got work to do and Leah here has to go home." She said the last while glaring at her sister.<br><br>"Ain't nothin' waitin' for me at home," Leah said, deftly sidestepping her sister. "I'd love to drink with you, Wesley. " She said the name as if she said it hundreds of times a day -- which she did -- and didn't notice the movement of Wes's eyebrows as she slid into a seat in the booth, looking up at him expectantly.<br><br>"The flip is good," she said.<br><br>Wes looked down at her dirty, scratched, bruised face for a second before taking the bench across from her. "A couple of flips," he said quietly to Bess.<br><br>Angrily, Bess flounced away toward the bar.<br><br>"You work for Ben now?" Wes asked Leah.<br><br>"I still live with my family." Her eyes were eating him, remembering every angle of his face, memorizing every curve. "Did you ever find your friend's wife?" she asked, referring to the first time she'd seen Wes.<br><br>For a moment he didn't understand. "Clay's wife?" he asked, then smiled, astonished. "You couldn't be that little girl who helped us?"<br><br>Silently, reverently, Leah pulled the worn gold coin from her skirt pocket and laid it on the table.<br><br>Wonderingly, Wes picked it up and held it toward the light to look at the rough hole drilled in the top of the coin. "How -- ?" he asked.<br><br>"A nail," she said, smiling. "It took me a while to make that hole but I was afraid I'd lose it if I didn't tie it to me."<br><br>Frowning, Wes put the coin back on the table. It was odd that the girl would keep the gold when she obviously needed so many things. Her hair, greasy beyond belief, was pulled back from her head and, idly, he wondered what color it would be if it were clean.<br><br>As Leah reached for the coin, she touched his fingertips and, her breath held, she touched them with her two fingers, marveling at the cleanliness of his nails, the shape of his big square-tipped fingers.<br><br>Bess set two mugs of flip on the table with a splash, while glaring at Leah. "Mr. Stanford, why don't you tell my sister here about that beautiful young lady you're about to marry? Leah'd just love to hear all about her. Tell her how pretty she is, how she can dance, what pretty clothes she has."<br><br>Wes moved his hand away from Leah's and chuckled. "Perhaps you should tell her, Bess, since you seem to know so much about my wife-to-be."<br><br>"I think I'll do that," Bess said, grabbing a chair from a nearby table and moving it to the end of their booth. But a took from Leah stopped her from sifting down.<br><br>"I'd rather hear what Wesley has to say," Leah said quietly, but her eyes bored into Bess's.<br><br>Bess's eyes held her sister's for a moment. Why was she trying to protect her sister? Isn't this what she'd wanted her to do? If only Leah weren't so <i>serious</i> about the man. With a sigh, Bess left them alone.<br><br>Wes drank deeply of his steaming drink while he looked at the emaciated girl across from him, and wondered how long she'd been a prostitute. She certainly was good at getting a man's attention in spite of her unappetizing appearance. The way she looked at him made him feel as if she'd been waiting all her life just for him. It was flattering, but at the same time it was disconcerting. It was almost as if she felt he owed her something.<br><br>"You were saying, Wesley...?" Leah prompted, leaning forward so that he got a whiff of her body odor.<br><br>"Kimberly," he said, only half-aloud. It might be better to think of Kim or, heaven help him, he might be tempted by this fragrant witch. "You're sure you want to hear? I mean, usually one woman doesn't want to hear about another woman."<br><br>"I wanta know all there is to know about you," she said with heartfelt sincerity.<br><br>"There's really not much to tell. We met about two years ago when she came to visit her brother, Steven Shaw. Their parents died when they were young and Kimberly was sent East to live with an aunt and uncle, while Steve stayed here with relatives."<br><br>Wesley's "not much to tell" turned into an hour of extended rapture. Wes had fallen for the beautiful Kimberly instantly, but so had tw...</p><h2>Modern Art and the Life of a Culture: The Religious Impulses of Modernism (Studies in Theology and the Arts Series)</h2><p><ul><li>Christianity Today's 2017 Book of the Year Award of Merit - Culture and the Arts</li></ul> For many Christians, engaging with modern art raises several questions: Is the Christian faith at odds with modern art? Does modernism contain religious themes? What is the place of Christian artists in the landscape of modern art? Nearly fifty years ago, Dutch art historian and theologian Hans Rookmaaker offered his answers to these questions when he published his groundbreaking work, <em>Modern Art and the Death of a Culture</em>, which was characterized by both misgivings and hopefulness. While appreciating Rookmaaker's invaluable contribution to the study of theology and the arts, this volume&#x2015;coauthored by an artist and a theologian&#x2015;responds to his work and offers its own answers to these questions by arguing that there were actually strong religious impulses that positively shaped modern visual art. Instead of affirming a pattern of decline and growing antipathy towards faith, the authors contend that theological engagement and inquiry can be perceived across a wide range of modern art&#x2015;French, British, German, Dutch, Russian and North American&#x2015;and through particular works by artists such as Gauguin, Picasso, David Jones, Caspar David Friedrich, van Gogh, Kandinsky, Warhol and many others. This book, the first in IVP Academic's new Studies in Theology and the Arts series, brings together the disciplines of art history and theology and points to the signs of life in modern art in order to help Christians navigate these difficult waters.</p><p>"Despite his often biting criticism and emphatic rejections of modern art, those who read Hans Rookmaaker closely know that the care and attentiveness he displayed in engaging the art of his day intimated a valuation far beyond mere condemnation. The same spirit of eager and attentive hospitality can be seen in this rejoinder by Bill Dyrness and Jon Anderson. With the studied investment in their diverse subjects and the poignant reflections emerging throughout, they have demonstrated that both Rookmaaker's vocation and burden are live categories for our time. More than a response to the original, <em>Modern Art and the Life of a Culture</em> is an invaluable companion to Rookmaaker and essential reading for any serious Christian encounter with modern art." (Taylor Worley, associate professor of faith and culture, Trinity International University)<br><br>"This is a book we have needed for a long time. The standard story of modern art, told by religious and non-religious people alike, is that it is the art of secularism and pervaded by nihilism. That was the story told by Hans Rookmaaker more than forty years ago in the book that became enormously influential among evangelicals, <em>Modern Art and the Death of a Culture</em>. Anderson and Dyrness tell a very different story. They show that modern art has been pervaded by religious concerns and theological issues. What they have dug up is truly amazing; the book is an eye-opener. They frame their story as a response to Rookmaaker. But the story they tell and the interpretations they offer are for everyone. Only those who refuse to read can ever again think of modern art in the old way." (Nicholas Wolterstorff, Noah Porter Professor Emeritus of Philosophical Theology, Yale University, senior research fellow, Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture, University of Virginia)<br><br>"As insightful as Hans Rookmaaker's provocative book <em>Modern Art and the Death of a Culture</em> (1970) was in tracing with broad strokes his concern with the cultural demise of Christian values in the post-Enlightenment West, Anderson and Dyrness make probing and illuminating use of the forty-five years of subsequent research to show that the sacred and secular have been far more complexly interwoven than Rookmaaker recognized. The authors, using the same end date, open up a broad spectrum of well-researched and illuminating contextual material that serves as a needed corrective to Rookmaaker's generalized schema and models a multidisciplinary, art-historical and theological approach that is deliberately generous, open and sympathetic rather than confrontational."

Great Britain, France, and Russia divided the globe in the nineteenth century, but Japan was catching up. Its army and navy were retrained by Western powers and equipped with the latest weapons and ships. Japan wanted to further emulate its European mentors and establish a protectorate over Korea, yet Japanese efforts were blocked by Imperial Russia who had their own designs on the peninsula.</p><p>The Russo-Japanese War started with a Japanese surprise naval attack against an anchored enemy fleet still believing itself at peace. It ended with the Battle of Tsushima, the most decisive surface naval battle of the 20th century. This gripping study describes this pivotal battle, and shows how the Japanese victory over Russia led to the development of the dreadnought battleship, and gave rise to an almost mythical belief in Japanese naval invincibility.</p></p><p><b>Mark Lardas </b>holds a degree in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, but spent his early career at the Johnson Space Center doing Space Shuttle structural analysis, and space navigation.

And when he awakens, she will be right there, waiting for him.</p><p>Alternating between real-life scenes with the baby tiger and his mother and enchanted dream scenes of sleep's possibilities, Kate Banks's simple, comforting text and Georg Hallensleben's bright, colorful illustrations make this a charming bedtime story for small children. </p><p><i>Close Your Eyes</i> is a 2002 New York Times Book Review Best Illustrated Book of the Year and a 2003 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p></p><p>A mother tiger wants her baby to go to sleep, but the little tiger resists. "'If I close my eyes,' he said, 'I can't see the sky.'" She assures him that he will not only see the sky when he sleeps, but will float among clouds and be cradled by the moon. Not in the least assured, the little tiger complains that if he closes his eyes, he will miss seeing the tree and the bird with blue feathers. With each concern, his mother consoles him with a comforting thought. If this gentle give-and-take were not calming enough for a bedtime story, Hallensleben's lovely dreamscapes (<i>And If the Moon Could Talk</i>) will surely do the trick. Double-page paintings of cloud animal shapes (with the little tiger cozying up with the moon), the "big mountains where the rain lives," and of mother tiger licking her baby are utterly hypnotic. Young children who are afraid to go to sleep will learn that "Dark is just the other side of light. It's what comes before dreams" and that mom is never very far away.

From health care to immigration, from the tax code to climate change, our political institutions cannot deal effectively with the challenges of modern society. Why the dysfunction? Contemporary reformers single out the usual suspects, including polarization and the rise in campaign spending. But what if the roots go much deeper, to the nation's founding?<br><br>In <i>Relic</i>, William G. Howell and Terry M. Moe point to the Constitution as the main culprit. The framers designed the Constitution some 225 years ago for a simple, agrarian society. But the government they created, with a parochial Congress at its center, is ill-equipped to address the serious social problems that arise in a complex, postindustrial nation. We are prisoners of the past, burdened with an antiquated government that cannot make effective policy, and often cannot do anything at all.<br><br>The solution is to update the Constitution for modern times. This can be accomplished, Howell and Moe argue, through reforms that push Congress and all its pathologies to the periphery of the lawmaking process, and bring presidents&#x2014;whose concern for their legacy drives them to seek coherent policy solutions&#x2014;to the center of decision making. As Howell and Moe reveal, the key to effective government for modern America is a more powerful presidency.<br><br><i>Relic</i> is a provocative and essential book for our era of political dysfunction and popular despair. It sheds new light on what is wrong with our government and what can be done about it, challenging us to reconsider the very foundation of the American experiment.<br></p><p><b>William G. Howell</b> is the Sydney Stein Professor in American Politics at the University of Chicago. His <i>The Wartime President</i> won the William Riker award for the best book in political economy.<br><br><b>Terry M. Moe</b> is the William Bennett Munro Professor of Political Science at Stanford University and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. Moe is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.<br>Clear-eyed and unapologetic, Howell and Moe insist that our nation's political woes stem not from our polarized political class but from an outdated Constitution. Anyone interested in our nation's political health will profit from exploring their bracing vision of how that Constitution now protects particularistic interests and propagates dysfunction.&#x201d;<br><b> Paul Pierson, UC Berkeley, and coauthor of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Winner-Take-All Politics</i></b><br><br> Howell and Moe deserve immense credit for connecting the dots' between our dangerously dysfunctional political system and an outmoded Constitution. One can only admire their willingness to challenge the cult of the Constitution that afflicts our political culture and hope that their book gets the widespread attention that it so richly deserves.&#x201d;<br><b> Sanford Levinson, University of Texas Law School, and author of <i>Framed: America's 51 Constitutions and the Crisis of Governance</i></b><br><br> Howell and Moe deliver the most concise, devastating account of congressional failure that I have ever read. In calling for a constitutional amendment that would increase the president's power over the legislative process, they have set the terms of debate for years to come.&#x201d;<br><b> Eric Posner, University of Chicago</b><br><br> The case for constitutional reform in <i>Relic</i> is the best certainly the most realistic in many years.... Just getting people to think seriously about constitutional reform would be progress. The cogent analysis in <i>Relic</i> helps to achieve that goal.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Wall Street Journal </i></b><br><br> Focused, committed, convincing, and composed in moderate language that will appeal to those all along the political continuum.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br> Howell and Moe make the bold and trenchant argument that the dysfunctions of American government lie squarely in the powers that the Founding Fathers gave Congress, and that the solution is to dramatically shift the balance of power to the executive.

Mao Zedong was the leader of a revolution, a communist who lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty, an aggressive and distrustful leader, and a man responsible for more civilian deaths than perhaps any other historical figure. Now, four decades after Mao&#39;s death, acclaimed biographer Philip Short presents a fully updated and revised edition of his ground-breaking and masterly biography. Vivid, uncompromising and unflinching, Short presents in one-volume the man behind the propaganda - his family, his beliefs and his horrors. In doing so he shows us both the human being Mao was, and the monster he became.</p><p>Of the three great tyrants of the 20th century--Hitler, Stalin, and Mao--the West generally knows the least about the latter. What we do know is that he was every bit as genocidal in his policies as either of the other two great villains of the age. In fact, in purely statistical terms, Mao might have been responsible for the deaths of more people than Hitler and Stalin combined. However, Philip Short's immense but immensely readable and impressively researched biography of the man goes far deeper than this. Yes, he acknowledges, Mao was a tyrant, but then China always has been run by tyrants; it never has had a tradition of democracy. And Mao was also an idealist: the deaths of millions was, as he saw it, the price that his country had to pay for being dragged from a state of medieval servitude--perpetually on the brink of famine--to that of a modern, industrialized, self-sufficient nation, in the space of a single lifetime. Short also humanizes Mao, and shows a man who had a profound and sincere interest in Chinese philosophy and poetry, and a surprisingly sharp sense of humor. None of this can exonerate Mao from the charge of inhumanity on an epic scale. But it does make for a much more rounded and complex portrait of the figure who, as the 21st century unfolds, might be shown to have had more influence on world history than either Hitler or Stalin. <i>--Christopher Hart, Amazon.co.uk</i>Philip Short was for thirty years a foreign correspondent for the BBC, based in Washington, Moscow, Paris, Tokyo and Beijing. He lived and worked in China for two decades in the 1970s and 1980s, and has returned regularly to the country ever since. He is the author of acclaimed biographies of Mitterrand (A Study in Ambiguity, Random House, 2013) and Pol Pot (Anatomy of a Nightmare, Henry Holt, 2006).</p><h2>The Eschatology of the Old Testament</h2><p>In this previously unpublished material, a pioneer in Reformed biblical theology examines the hopes, expectations, and understanding of Old Testament saints regarding the future. Compiled from several manuscripts relating to Geerhardus Vos&#39;s course on Old Testament eschatology, this volume weaves together the most complete text of his study on the subject. Vos addresses a wide range of questions surrounding both individual and collective eschatology from key passages throughout the Old Testament. Whether he is discussing the intermediate state or the meaning of Sheol, Messianic expectations or the Day of the Lord, Vos&#39;s supernaturalism contrasts with the hopelessness of naturalistic views.</p><p><b>Geerhardus Vos</b> (1862-1949) was born in the Netherlands and emigrated to the USA in 1881. He earned degrees from Calvin Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, and the University of Strasbourg (PhD in Arabic). In 1894 he was ordained as a minister in the Presbyterian Church in the USA. Before beginning a thirty-nine year tenure on Princeton's faculty, he was professor of systematic and exegetical theology at Calvin for five years.</p><h2>Leave It to Cleaver (A Vintage Kitchen Mystery)</h2><p><b>In the brand-new Vintage Kitchen Mystery from the author of <i>White Colander Crime</i>, someone with an old grudge decides it&#x2019;s time to bury the hatchet . . .</b> &#x201c;Smartly written and successfully plotted, the debut of this new cozy series . . . exudes authenticity.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i> on <i>A Deadly Grind</i> Vintage cookware and cookbook collector Jaymie Leighton has agreed to help her sister clear out the house of a deceased older neighbor, and she&#x2019;s thrilled at the prospect of discovering antique kitchenware and other treasures&#x2014;until she opens a vintage trunk in the cellar and finds the remains of a teenage girl with a cleaver buried in her skull.

In Lucifer, Jeffrey Burton Russell continues his compelling study of the personification of evil in the figure of the Devil. The previous two volumes in this remarkable tertalogy&#x2015;The Devil and Satan&#x2015;trace the history of the concept of the devil comparatively as it emerged in diverse cultures and followed its development in Western thought from the ancient Hebrew religion through the first five centuries of the Christian era.</p><p>The present volume charts the evolution of the concept of the devil from the fifth century through the fifteenth. Drawing on an impressive array of sources from popular religion, art, literature, and drama, as well as from scholastic philosophy, mystical theology, homiletics, and hagiography, Russell provides a detailed treatment of Christian diabology in the Middle Ages. Although he focuses primarily on Western Christian thought, Russell also includes, for the sake of comparison, material on the concept of the devil in Greek Orthodoxy during the Byzantine period as well as in Muslim thought.</p><p>Russell recounts how the Middle Ages saw a refinement in detail rather than a radical alteration of diabological theory. He shows that the medieval concept of the devil, fundamentally unchanged over the course of the centuries, eventually gave rise to the unyielding beliefs that resulted in the horrifying cruelties of the witch-hunting craze in the 1500s and 1600s. This major contribution to the history of the Middle Ages and to the history of religion will enlighten scholars and students alike and will appeal to anyone concerned with the problem of evil in our world.</p></p><p>Jeffrey Burton Russell is Professor of History Emeritus at the University of California, Santa Barbara.<p>"An attractively written survey of the way the devil appears in art, literature and treatise, during the medieval period, with many signs of an engaging sense of personal commitment to the subject, and an attempt to show its contemporary relevance."</p> (John O. Ward <i>Journal of Religious History</i>)<br><br><p>"Russell shows an admirable mastery of a vast and varied array of sources, and an equally admirable skill in summarizing them."</p> (Norman Cohn <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br><p>"If, as Chesterton claimed, the devil's greatest triumph was convincing the modern world that he doesn't exist, Jeffrey Burton Russell means to rob him of his victory. <i>Lucifer</i> is both a scholarly assessment of the development of diabology in the Middle Ages and an impassioned plea to the 20th century to recognize and acknowledge the existence of real, objective evil. The third in a series of works tracing the history of the devil... it represents a formidable undertaking: the devil's history is integrally related to the problem of evil, which is in turn at the heart of Western religious thought. Each of the volumes comprises, in essence, a judicious and able tour of Christian theology from the villain's point of view.... In <i>Lucifer</i>, Russell provides a wealth of documentatlon on the extent to which the devil is simply the projection onto a living being of our fears and hostilities about the universe, our neighbors, and ourselves.... A pleasure to read."</p> (John Boswell <i>The New Republic</i>)</p><h2>Secrets Of A Civil War Submarine: Solving The Mysteries Of The H. L. Hunley</h2><p><p>On February 17, 1864, the <em>H.L. Hunley </em>made history as the first submarine to sink a ship in battle. Soldiers on the shore waited patiently after seeing the submarine&#x2019;s return signal. But after several days, the ship had failed to return. What had gone wrong? In 1995, after over 130 years of searching, the<em> H.L. Hunley </em>was finally found buried off the coast of South Carolina. Follow author, Sally M.

Sally especially enjoys writing narrative nonfiction that captures the reader's attention with a true story. She is also the author of 2019 Orbis Pictus Honor Book <em>Champion: The Comeback Tale of the American Chestnut</em>.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Grade 6-10&#x2013;Walker brings a little-known story of the Civil War to life in this fascinating book. When the Union blockade of all ports in the South stopped supplies from reaching the Confederate Army, Horace L. Hunley decided to create a submarine that would be able to sneak up on enemy ships and blow them up. After many years of trial and error, the <i>H. L. Hunley</i> actually succeeded in sinking the USS <i>Housatonic</i> in February of 1864. But the submarine never returned to port, and her crew perished in the Charleston Harbor. This is a finely crafted account of the <i>Hunley</i> from its inception to the modern archaeological quest to exhume her from the water. It is divided into chronological chapters complete with pictures, maps, and primary sources. Half of the book discusses the construction and design of the submarine, in addition to its practice runs and its first and only mission. The second half consists of the process of locating and excavating the <i>Hunley</i>, as well as piecing together the puzzle of exactly what happened on that fateful night in 1864. The archaeological process is well documented in both words and pictures, and the conclusions are interesting and even surprising. Highly recommended for school and public libraries.<i>&#x2013;Anna M. Nelson, Collier County Public Library, Naples, FL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

KING ABDULLAH II, AUTHOR OF LOVE IN THE HOLY QURAN. Those who read translations of the Qur an (and there are no completely accurate translations of the Qur an in English and only a few adequate ones (these being arguably Abdullah Yusuf Ali s; Mohammed Marmaduke Pickthall s), Laleh Bakhtiar s translation is arguably the most internally consistent. They are not reading the Qur an, but rather mere subjective individual interpretations of it: the Qur an is God s Word in its Arabic form only. The work Dr. Bakhtiar has put into her interpretation the consistency, the method, the attention to tense, root, case and detail is second to none. I have never seen its like before. The English reading of it is also lovely and smooth. This is clearly a blessing God has blessed her with, ma sha Allah. H.R.H. Prince Ghazi JOHN ESPOSITO, HEAD OF GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR MUSLIM/CHRISTIAN UNDERSTANDING. I am very familiar with Laleh Bakhtiar&#39;s writings and her recent translation of the Quran. Sublime Quran is a major translation that, in contrast to many other translations, in clear and direct language, effectively makes the message of the Quran accessible to English speaking audiences. It is one that I often recommend. REZA ASLAN, AN INTERNATIONALLY ACCLAIMED WRITER AND SCHOLAR OF RELIGIONS AND CONTRIBUTING EDITOR AT THE DAILY BEAST. I am quite a fan of your mothers and routinely talk about her Quran translation in my speeches and in my classes. Here&#39;s a quote for you: For 14 centuries the translation and interpretation of the Quran has been the sole purview of men. Only men have been empowered to define the meaning and message of the Quran, and it is no coincidence that their interpretation has often been misogynist or worse. Laleh Bakhtiar&#39;s incredible achievement has changed all that. For the first time a woman has been able to reengage the scripture from a different point of view, thus producing a gender neutral translation that is far more consistent with the message and spirit of the Quran than any previous translation. REZA ASLAN SHAIDA KHAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DOMESTIC HARMONY FOUNDATION, a non-profit organization working against domestic violence within Muslim, Middle Eastern and South Asian communities (based in Long Island, NY) Laleh was the keynote speaker at their Annual Fundraising Gala on April 17, 2010 in Long Island, NY. There are numerous reasons for the importance of Laleh Bakhtiar&#39;s translation of the Holy Quran, the least of which is that her Sublime Quran provides a sensible and humanistic interpretation for the holy book. As the Executive Director of the Domestic Harmony Foundation, a non-profit organization working against domestic violence within Muslim, Middle Eastern and South Asian communities, this interpretation of Ms. Bakhtiar&#39;s is particularly significant. We are often faced with individuals who are victimized by their partners&#39; usage of Quranic verses to further their abusive gains, citing the controversial verse 4:34. Her interpretation provides a more Islamic minded approach- that when all else fails, to move away from - the wife should be the last resort, and not to hit. This meaning is particularly important in our field of work when the victims and the abusers need to be educated as to the real nature of Islamic teachings.</p><p>Laleh Bakhtiar has a BA in History from Chatham College, Pittsburgh, PA, MA in Philosophy, MA in Counseling Psychology and Ph.D. in Educational Psychology and is also a Licensed Professional Psychotherapist in the State of Illinois. She is co-author of A Sense of Unity: The Sufi Tradition in Persian Architecture (University of Chicago Press) and author of SUFI Expressions of the Mystic Quest (Thames and Hudson), three volumes of God s Will Be Done on Moral Healing and some 15 other books on various aspects of Islam. Through the works on psychology she has become the leading authority on the Sufi integration of the Enneagram. She is the first American woman to provide a critical translation of the Quran. In her Sublime Quran translation she interprets the controversial verse that has lead to domestic violence in the Islamic community to the way the Prophet understood it. Instead of husbands being allowed to beat their wives, she translates: husbands should go away, let the anger subside and then consult with one another. She has traveled around the world three times giving lectures on topics on the right of Muslim women. She is an expert in the psychology of spiritual chivalry (futuwwa, javanmardi). She directs her work towards Muslim women and youth who, once they learn of this model of spiritual chivalry become more positive oriented towards their faith and family. She is presently Director of the Institute of Traditional Psychology and In-House Scholar at Kazi Publications. She taught Islam at the University of Chicago. She has a computer based training program on the internet. SHAIDA KHAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DOMESTIC HARMONY FOUNDATION. Equally as important as Dr. Bakhtiar&#39;s interpretation is the very fact that as a knowledgeable female scholar. She is an exemplary individual particularly for women who have been victimized by domestic violence, and also for all Muslim women to look up to. Shaida Khan INGRID MATTSON, PAST PRESIDENT THE ISLAMIC SOCIETY OF NORTH AMERICA AND PROFESSOR OF ISLAMIC STUDIES HARTFORD SEMINARY. Current events have left Americans fascinated and frightened by Islam and Muslims. With no end in sight of the war on terror; and questions about the compatibility of Islam with Western societies, the need for honest and accurate information about Muslims has never been greater. In the case of Muslim women especially, ignorance and sensationalism abound. What could be more welcome than an examination of the life of a Muslim woman who is neither a silent victim of oppression, waiting to be saved by a secular revolution, nor an apologist for misguided ideology, but an intelligent woman of faith and integrity? Laleh Bakhtiar has lived a remarkable life - but a life with which we can relate, because while some of her experiences appear exotic to the typical American, her values and principles are not. A biography of Laleh Bakhtiar is sure to shed much needed light on humanity.MARCIA HERMANSEN DIRECTOR OF ISLAMIC WORLD STUDIES PROGRAM AND PROFESSOR IN THE THEOLOGY DEPARTMENT LOYOLA UNIVERSITY CHICAGO. One of things that strikes me about the translation is how its reception in the mainstream; Muslim community--at least in North America, made it less acceptable or even unacceptable for Muslim community leaders to simply repeat misogynistic interpretations. I refer specifically to the ISNA representative in Canada who wanted to ban the book--and the response from US leadership that ISNA supports women's rights and allows expression of a variety of opinions on Islam. It is clear that this pioneering project opened up conversations about gender relations in the community that needed to take place, and provoked a productive re-examination of assumptions about interpretation and authority. --Sublime Quran website; Wikipedia: Laleh Bakhtiar<br><br>YORIYOS SON OF YUSUF ISLAM (FORMERLY CAT STEVENS) We love and appreciate the work your mother has done and continues to do, Alhamdullilah.

A French-American woman aiding refugees in sub-Saharan Africa, facing the utter chaos of a society where life has become meaningless. A Chinese doctor trying to stay alive during Mao's cultural revolution, discovering that the only values that matter are those that get you beyond the next threat. These individuals found themselves caught in circumstances where those things that matter most to them--their desires, status, relationships, resources, political and religious commitments, life itself--have been challenged by the society around them. Each is caught up in existential moral experiences that define what it means to be human, with an intensity that makes their life narratives arresting. <br><br>These stories reveal just how malleable moral life is, and just how central danger is to our worlds and our livelihood. Indeed, Kleinman offers in this book a groundbreaking approach to ethics, examining "who we are" through some of the most disturbing issues of our time--war, globalization, poverty, social injustice--all in the context of actual lived moral life.<br></p><p><br><strong>Arthur Kleinman</strong> is Esther and Sidney Rabb Professor and Chair, Department of Anthropology, Harvard University, and Professor of Medical Anthropology in Social Medicine and Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School.

It offers the kind of insight that makes you think and think again. But it isn't only analytical. For me at least, the richness of the book comes mainly from the stories Dr. Kleinman tells, about patients and friends and one remarkable historical figure--complicated stories that confront life's miseries and renew the cheapened word 'inspiring.'"--Tracy Kidder<p></p><br>"In this searingly written book, Arthur Kleinman takes us deep into the contrasting worlds of genuine reality and cultural pretense which he has spent so much of his life exploring. I have rarely read such a powerful portrayal of what Kleinman wonderfully calls 'the quality of anti-heroic everydayness.'"--Jonathan D. Spence<p></p><br>"In this luminous new book, master scholar Arthur Kleinman offers a handful of stories that open a channel between personal experience and the broader contexts--such as war or illness--in which we live our short lives. <em>What Really Matters</em> is a stern yet humble antidote to the shallow self-help books now crowding bestseller lists. It is also an instructive, deeply affecting and, in the end, transcendent and spiritual book."--Dr. Paul Farmer, Founding Director of Partners in Health, and author of <em>Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights, and the New War on the Poor</em><p></p><br>"Arthur Kleinman is one of the most broadly informed and wisest people in the life sciences, bridging medicine and the social sciences in a way that is extremely rare and valuable.

Will the future of the Net be set by Internet engineers, rogue programmers, the United Nations, or powerful countries? Who's really in control of what's happening on the Net?<br> In this provocative new book, Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu tell the fascinating story of the Internet's challenge to governmental rule in the 1990s, and the ensuing battles with governments around the world. It's a book about the fate of one idea--that the Internet might liberate us forever from government, borders, and even our physical selves. We learn of Google's struggles with the French government and Yahoo's capitulation to the Chinese regime; of how the European Union sets privacy standards on the Net for the entire world; and of eBay's struggles with fraud and how it slowly learned to trust the FBI. In a decade of events the original vision is uprooted, as governments time and time again assert their power to direct the future of the Internet. The destiny of the Internet over the next decades, argue Goldsmith and Wu, will reflect the interests of powerful nations and the conflicts within and between them. <br> While acknowledging the many attractions of the earliest visions of the Internet, the authors describe the new order, and speaking to both its surprising virtues and unavoidable vices. Far from destroying the Internet, the experience of the last decade has lead to a quiet rediscovery of some of the oldest functions and justifications for territorial government. While territorial governments have unavoidable problems, it has proven hard to replace what legitimacy governments have, and harder yet to replace the system of rule of law that controls the unchecked evils of anarchy. While the Net will change some of the ways that territorial states govern, it will not diminish the oldest and most fundamental roles of government and challenges of governance. <br> Well written and filled with fascinating examples, including colorful portraits of many key players in Internet history, this is a work that is bound to stir heated debate in the cyberspace community.<br></p><p>Advance Praise for <i>Who Controls the Internet?</i> "It is time that America learn an important lesson about the Internet--that however cyber the space is, it is also real, and subject to real space governments. This is the very best work to make this fundamental point. Goldsmith and Wu have made understandable and accessible an argument political culture should have realized a decade ago." -- Lawrence Lessig, author of <i>Code</i> and <i>Free Culture</i> "Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu are among the most creative and provocative legal scholars of their generation. In this surprising, unsentimental, and ultimately optimistic book, they reject romantic abstractions about the globalizing and transformative power of the Internet. National laws, traditions, and customs are just as important in controlling cyberspace as they are in real space, they argue. And that's a good thing because decentralized control can encourage freedom, diversity, and self-determination. Combining realism with idealism, <i>Who Controls the Internet?</i> offers an adult manifesto for the future of freedom in an interconnected world." -- Jeffrey Rosen, author of <i>The Naked Crowd</i> <p> "Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu have written an informative, engaging and provocative book that will undoubtedly challenge most people's preconceptions of the Internet. This is the most important book about the politics of the Internet since Lawrence Lessig's <i>Code</i>." -- Daniel W. Drezner, University of Chicago and danieldrezner.com "In the 1990s the Internet was greeted as the New New Thing: It would erase national borders, give rise to communal societies that invented their own rules, undermine the power of governments. In this splendidly argued book, Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu explain why these early assumptions were mostly wrong: The Internet turns out to illustrate the enduring importance of Old Old Things, such as law and national power and business logic. By turns provocative and colorful, this is an essential read for anyone who cares about the relationship between technology and globalization." -- Sebastian Mallaby, Editorial Writer and Columnist, <i>The Washington Post</i></p><br><strong>Jack Goldsmith</strong> is Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and author most recently of <em>The Limits of International Law</em>.

The authors explore a wide range of questions such as: Do GMOs threaten rural livelihoods? Why don&#x2019;t we eat dogs? Does your neighborhood make you fat? Do community gardens encourage urban gentrification? Can cheese save a local economy? Why are gourmet burgers appearing on menus all over the world? How do immigrants use food to create a sense of place? Does mainstream nutrition stigmatize bodies? Is the kitchen an oppressive place? Can celebrity chefs change the food system?

It is provocative and engaging reading offering fresh perspectives on the food challenges encountered in everyday life today.... Most engaging are the &#x201c;food for thought&#x201d; segments between chapters, which allow the reader to &#x201c;digest&#x201d; the material through reflection, activities, and recipes intended to get the reader out in the community as a participant-observer or in the kitchen as a critically aware cook.... In sum, Food and Place: A Critical Exploration is not only a fascinating college textbook, which, in this case, is not an oxymoron. But also it will resonate with the general public interested in provocative contemporary questions such as: Why don&#x2019;t we eat dogs? Does your neighborhood make you fat? Do community gardens encourage urban gentrification? Can cheese save a local economy? Is the kitchen an oppressive place? (<i>New York Journal of Books</i>)<br><br>This exciting and expansive book convincingly argues that place is an essential lens through which to view all aspects of the food system, from bodies to landscapes to global economic flows. It is essential reading for scholars, students, activists, and policy makers working to create a more just and sustainable food system. (Alison Alkon, Associate Professor of Sociology, University of the Pacific)<br><br>Across the globe, how are food practices, from production to consumption, shaped by the spaces in which they occur, and in turn, how do they transform places and contribute to place-making? This thoroughly engaging critical analysis takes us from GMOs to gentrification and from bio-politics to body politics, making it a must read for activists and academics alike. (Julian Agyeman, Tufts University)<br><br>Offering students lucid explanations of key concepts, this collection is an excellent introduction to today&#x2019;s food and farming issues. Drawing on the latest research from multiple disciplines, the authors cover the central debates in areas such as ethical eating, social policy, and food politics. Students will come away with a deeper understanding of the spatiality of food practices, the ways food makes place, and how relations of power&#x2014;race, gender, class&#x2014;always shape these geographies. (Rachel Slocum, SIT Graduate Institute)<br><br>Food systems are as dynamic as the global economy they have developed within. Because of this, we require vigilant and far-reaching analyses of the changes within food systems and how, in turn, these place-based changes disrupt people&#x2019;s lives. This excellent book, including some of today's most important scholars of food and place, does just this. (Nik Heynen, University of Georgia)<br><br>Food and Place is a powerful collection of essays that explores the intimate relationships between what we eat and where we live&#x2014;and how those relationships shape individual and geographic identities. Joassart-Marcelli and Bosco link global industrial food regimes to the landscapes they produce and the cultural meanings inherent in the food people ultimately consume. Their through-line is justice: for immigrant pickers and slaughterhouse workers, for urban communities facing food insecurity, and for diverse individuals confronting exclusionary food cultures. This is an important book for anyone interested in the critical role of food in our lives, livelihoods, and environments.

Why do women become guerrilla insurgents? What experiences do they have in guerrilla armies? And what are the long-term repercussions of this participation for the women themselves and the societies in which they live? <br><br><em>Women in War</em> answers these questions while providing a rare look at guerrilla life from the viewpoint of rank-and-file participants. Using data from 230 in-depth interviews with men and women guerrillas, guerrilla supporters, and non-participants in rural El Salvador, <em>Women in War</em> investigates why some women were able to channel their wartime actions into post-war gains, and how those patterns differ from the benefits that accrued to men. By accounting for these variations, <em>Women in War</em> helps resolve current, polarized debates about the effects of war on women, and by extension, develops our nascent understanding of the effects of women combatants on warfare, political violence, and gender systems. <br><br>In the process, Women in War also develops a new model for investigating micro-level mobilization processes that has applications to many movement settings. Micro-level mobilization processes are often ignored in the social movement literature in favor of more macro- and meso-level analyses. Yet individuals who share the same macro-level context, and who are embedded in the same meso-level networks, often have strikingly different mobilization experiences. Only a portion are ever moved to activism, and those who do mobilize vary according to which paths they follow to mobilization, what skills and social ties they forge through participation, and whether they continue their political activism after the movement ends. By examining these individual-level variations, a micro-level theory of mobilization can extend the findings of macro- and meso-level analyses, and improve our understanding of how social movements begin, why they endure, and whether they change the societies they target.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jocelyn Viterna</strong> is Associate Professor of Sociology at Harvard University.<br><br>"Jocelyn Viterna develops an 'identity-based' theory of political mobilization to explain why and how some women, but not others, joined the clandestine camps of El Salvador's armed revolutionary movement during the 1980s. Her account wisely encompasses broad political and economic factors while emphasizing the importance of activist strategies and the collective identities of the women targeted for recruitment. All future research on social movements, political violence, and gender will have to grapple with Viterna's provocative theory." --Jeff Goodwin, New York University <br><p></p><br>"<em>Women in War</em> is an in-depth look at how women were mobilized, served, and transformed by their roles as combatants and non-combatants by the FMLN - the guerrillas - in the Salvadoran civil war. Having myself served for a year in the midst of that conflict as a physician, the gender dynamics, insights, and experiences that Women in War present are a valuable contribution to understanding the post-conflict reality of these women in today's El Salvador." --Charlie Clements, M.D., M.P.H, author of <em>Witness to War</em> <br><p></p><br>"In this stellar book, Jocelyn Viterna brings much needed sophistication to the literature on women and war. She shows that the tired debate on political participation in war as empowerment or victimization should be superseded by analysis of the specific conditions under which women exert agency and those under which they are victimized. This book should be read not only by scholars of civil war and insurgency, but also by policy-makers working toward post-conflict reconciliation and development." --Elisabeth Jean Wood, Yale University <br><p></p><br>"Viterna develops a sophisticated, micro-level, political mobilization theory to explain individual variations in social movement participation. This is an important contribution to the study of gender, violence, and political mobilization. Highly recommended." --<em>CHOICE</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Women in War</em> provides an innovative theory of micromobilization that will serve collective action scholars and students for decades to come. Viterna's participation identity theory complements the microstructural revolution of movement recruitment and participation that scholars such as David Snow, Doug McAdam, Bert Klandermans, Roger Gould and important others pioneered in the 1980s and 1990s. By emphasizing the process of activist role taking, her conceptual scheme convincingly moves beyond social networks alone as the principal causal force driving political participation. ...a 'must read.'" --<em>Mobilization</em><p></p><br>"<em>Women in War</em> [is] a very historically, methodologically, theoretically, and empirically compelling read.

This textbook and professional reference offers a comprehensive overview of the field. Drawing on ideas, tools, and techniques from such disciplines as sociology, cognitive science, organizational behavior, and information science, it describes KM theory and practice at the individual, community, and organizational levels. Chapters cover such topics as tacit and explicit knowledge, theoretical modeling of KM, the KM cycle from knowledge capture to knowledge use, KM tools, KM assessment, and KM professionals.</p><p>This third edition has been completely revised and updated to reflect advances in the dynamic and emerging field of KM. The specific changes include extended treatment of tacit knowledge; integration of such newer technologies as social media, visualization, mobile technologies, and crowdsourcing; a new chapter on knowledge continuity, with key criteria for identifying knowledge at risk; material on how to identify, document, validate, share, and implement lessons learned and best practices; the addition of new categories of KM jobs; and a new emphasis on the role of KM in innovation. Supplementary materials for instructors are available online.</p></p><p>Kimiz Dalkir is Associate Professor and Director at McGill University&#39;s School of Information Studies.

Essays include<br> &nbsp;<br> � &nbsp;Robert Moses&#x2019;s historically rooted call for citizens, especially young people, to make the demand for quality education<br> &nbsp;<br> � &nbsp;Ernesto Cort�s&#x2019;s view from decades of work organizing Latino communities in Texas <br> &nbsp;<br> � &nbsp;Charles Payne&#x2019;s interview with students from the Baltimore Algebra Project, who organized to make historic demands on their district <br> &nbsp;<br> � &nbsp;Legal scholar Imani Perry&#x2019;s nuanced analysis of the prospects of making a case for quality education as a right guaranteed by the Constitution<br> &nbsp;<br> � &nbsp;Perspectives from scholars Lisa Delpit and Joan T. Wynne, and by teachers Alicia Caroll and Kim Parker, who provide examples of what quality education is, describing its goal, and how to guide practice in the meantime</p><p><b>Robert Moses</b> is the author of <i>Radical Equations</i> (Beacon / 3127-8 / $16.00 pb).<b>Ern�sto Cortes Jr.</b> is director of the Southwest Regional Industrial Areas Foundation.<b>Theresa Perry</b> is professor of Africana studies and education at Simmons College and author of<i>Young, Gifted, and Black</i> (Beacon / 3105-6 / $16.00 pb). <b>Lisa Delpit</b> is director of the Center for Urban Educational Excellence at Georgia State University and author of<i>Other People&#x2019;s Children</i>.<br><p><b>From the Introduction by Theresa Perry<br></b><br>It is our hope that this book will be used to provoke discussion and debate in local communities and to support organizers in their efforts to find answers to these questions&#x2014;what constitutes quality educa�tion, and what are the legislative routes towards getting the govern�ment to encode quality education as a protected right? <br><br>The book begins with an introductory essay by Linda Mizell. We noted that in early days after slavery, African Americans developed a movement to demand that the government protect their right to an education. Mizell provides us with an example of how this occurred in Florida in the early days of emancipation, during Reconstruction, and during the progressive era. According to Mizell, African Ameri�cans saw "education as <i>not simply a civil right or even as a human right, but as a divine right. </i>For them, there was little distinction be�tween political work, social uplift work, and education activ�ism&#x2014;<i>all </i>of it was God&#x2019;s work. . . . In a very real sense, every African American organization or institution of the period was an educational one&#x2014;that is, with rare exception, no matter what the organization&#x2019;s primary purpose, be it social, political, civic, cultural or fraternal, education was central to its mission and its work.&#x201d; Mizell&#x2019;s essay challenges us to bring these understandings to our contemporary organizing efforts. <br><br>In developing the Algebra Project, Bob envisioned young people as math literacy workers, who, like the SNCC workers of the sixties, would be the shock troops, demanding something of themselves and of the adults working in and making policy for schools and school systems. Charles Payne&#x2019;s interview of the Baltimore Algebra Project students stands in stark contrast to the popular narrative about young Black youth as a group who don&#x2019;t value education. The young people talk about their activism, give us details about their campaign for quality education, their sit-ins, mock trial of the state superintendent, and their systematic work with middle school students taking alge�bra. This was and is Bob Moses&#x2019;s vision for the Algebra Project, the essence of what he learned from Ella Baker. It would be the youth who would lead the way. <br><br>The essays in part II by Jeannie Oakes, Bob Moses, Ernesto Cort�s, and Imani Perry are designed to help us grapple with the following questions: Can the Constitution guarantee quality education? What are the routes that can lead us in that direction? What is the role of organizers in a legal fight? What coalitions are necessary? How can the fight for quality education be waged at the state, city, and federal levels? What new understanding of the law can be employed that will be likely to succeed at this time, when we have the first African Amer�ican president in the White House and a Democratic Congress? How might the thirteenth amendment be used to support congressional legislation to encode into law and guarantee quality education? <br><br>Part III of this book begins with essays by two exemplary educators, Alicia Carroll, a kindergarten teacher, and Kimberly N. Parker, a high school teacher. These essays, along with essays by Joan T. Wynne and Janice Giles on Bob Moses&#x2019;s summer math program for high school students, and Lisa Delpit on culturally responsive teaching, should prompt rich conversations and debates about what constitutes quality education. Can we codify a definition of quality? All of the essays in this section are meant to suggest that as we organize to make quality education a constitutionally guaranteed right, we have to be about the business of instantiating excellence in the meantime. The essays pro�vide a starting point for local communities to begin conversations, grounded in practice, about what constitutes quality education. Over the two decades of the school reform movement, foundation money has supported school systems and school reform and policy organiza�tions to discuss, propose, and enact visions of education for Black and Brown communities. It is time for our communities to begin to have these conversations. Tentative and ever-evolving answers to these questions will inform organizing efforts to make quality education a constitutionally guaranteed right. <br><br>For those of us committed to transforming sharecropper educa�tion to quality education, this is both a complicated and hopeful time. It is complicated because school reform has become a top-down phenomenon. We have seen the increasing disenfranchisement of lo�cal communities in decisions about schools and in discussion about the contents of public education. And as the public sphere has become demonized, so have public schools. Bob Moses has opined that we seem content to move students around and create ways for a few kids to get a better education, rather than trying to transform the system as a whole. <br><br>It is a hopeful time because there are stirrings of a renewed sense that government must play a role in addressing historic inequities. Youth are organizing, and disenfranchised communities are demand�ing quality education. While there are over forty state lawsuits related to the equalization of education, we have a better understanding of what has to happen, even if the plaintiffs are victorious, for equity to be actualized in schools. <br><br>President Obama&#x2019;s victory on a campaign of hope opens imagina�tive possibilities. Imagine if President Obama talked straight to the nation, and specifically to the children and families in urban and ru�ral communities, telling them, &#x201c;I know I am asking you to pursue excellence in a context of inequities.&#x201d; What if he said, &#x201c;I know that in some of your schools you don&#x2019;t have libraries, auditoriums, gyms, computers. But you still have to work hard and study hard. And I promise you, I will try and make it so that by the end of my second term all children have what they need to achieve in their schools&#x201d;? What if he said that he was ushering in the next stage of the struggle for quality education? Imagine President Obama convening a work�ing group of educators, youth and adult organizers, legal and edu�cational scholars, charging them with developing an understanding of the resource requirements for an education in the twenty-first century and exploring how to encode these requirements in federal legislation that would make it a right for every child to have access to these resources in his or her school. Or to state it differently, what if he spearheaded the development of legislation that required states to deliver on these requirements with an accompanying authoriza�tion for federal funding to assist local and state governmental units meet their legislative responsibilities? When we heard that the money for school construction was being taken out of the stimulus package, many of us were disappointed. However, the real issue is that there is no federal requirement that the state or localities provide a floor of resources for our schools, urban or rural. <br><br>We all know that President Obama is the product of a White Amer�ican mother and a Kenyan father, and that he lived and attended pri�vate schools in Indonesia and Hawaii. However, as a young adult, in his search for identity, he chose to identify as African American. He moved to Chicago, where Black means African American, organized on the south side of Chicago in the African American community, married an African American woman, and attended an Afrocentric African American church for close to twenty years. In these environ�ments, he learned and gained facility in the use of Black language and in Black cultural practices, formal and informal, which have been on full display in his speeches and interactions during the campaign and since his election as president. We remember the fist bump that he and his wife, Michelle, shared on stage and his response to the cashier at the restaurant in Washington, D.C, when, after he was asked if he needed change, he said, &#x201c;We straight.&#x201d; We recall how in a campaign speech to a largely Black audience, he effectively used words that Spike Lee had attributed to Malcolm in the movie <i>Malcom X</i>. He said, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re try�ing to bamboozle you. It&#x2019;s the same old okey-doke. Y&#x2019;all know about okey-doke, right?&#x201d; In speaking about the extravagant lifestyles of bank executives, he excoriated them for living &#x201c;high on the hog.&#x201d; In his speeches, he used Black rhetorical style&#x2014;repetition, rhythm, and actual phrases that are reminiscent of the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#x2014;and the preaching style of Black ministers generally: &#x201c;They said this day would never come. They said our sights were set too high. They said this country was too divided.&#x201d; Having located himself inside this tradition, he spoke in a way that had resonance for Black Americans particularly and at the same time spoke to all Americans. <br><br>Having chosen an African American identity, President Obama will, we hope, also claim his place in the African American tradition of seeing education as a path to freedom and will use the office of president to support these strivings. <br><br>Now is the time for ordinary people to be heard, to demand that the government at all levels (federal, state, and local) guarantee qual�ity education, and for ordinary people to offer robust descriptions of quality education, ones that can be encoded in law and monitored by appropriate governmental agencies as well as an organized and vigi�lant public.</p></p><h2>The Body Broken</h2><p><p><em>The Body Broken</em> is a thematic survey of Europe in the late Middle Ages, a period of huge crisis, conflict and religious change that included the Black Death, the Reformation, the Peasants&#x2019; Revolt and the Renaissance.</p> <p></p> <p>This thoroughly updated and revised second edition retains the thematic approach of the first edition, combining sweeping interpretive synthesis with careful attention to recent and revisionist scholarship.

It provides workers and students in physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, and atmospheric studies with the foundation for the analysis of stellar atmospheres, planetary illumination, and sky radiation. Though radiative transfer has been investigated chiefly as a phenomenon of astrophysics, in recent years it has attracted the attentions of physicists as well, since essentially the same problems arise in the theory of diffusion of neutrons." &#x2014; Morton D. Hall, Distinguished Service Professor, University of Chicago<br>Chandrasekhar presents the subject of radiative transfer in plane-parallel atmosphere as a branch of mathematical physics, with its own characteristic methods and techniques. He begins with a formulation and analysis of fundamental problems. It is shown how allowance can be made for the polarization of the radiation field by using a set of parameters first introduced by Stokes. Successive chapters deal with transfer problems in semi-infinite and finite atmosphere; Rayleigh scattering; the radiative equilibrium of a stellar atmosphere; and related astrophysical and mathematical problems. The mathematical methods employed are extremely powerful, and by means of them it has been possible to handle problems which could not be treated previously, such as the scattering of polarized light.</p><p>Indian-born astrophysicist S. Chandrasekhar (1910&#x2013;95) was a Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago and a co-recipient of the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics. NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory is named for him (<i>chandra</i> also means "moon" or "luminous" in Sanskrit). <p><b>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: A Shining Star</b> <br>The great Indian astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (1910&#x2013;1995), recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983 for his work on the later evolutionary stages of massive stars, was not only the author of several books reprinted by Dover over many years, but a frequent and highly valued reviewer of titles in his field during the 1970s and 1980s. Chandrasekhar's books, published by Dover, are: <i>An Introduction to the Theory of Stellar Structure,</i> 1967; <i>Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability,</i> 1981; <i>Principles of Stellar Dynamics,</i> 2005; <i>Ellipsoidal Figures of Equilibrium,</i> 1987; and <i>Radiative Transfer,</i> 1960. </p><p> </p><p>For those concerned with the distant future &#x2015; the really distant future &#x2015; Chandrasekhar's name will always be associated with the Chandrasekhar Limit, the figure of 1.44 solar masses, the minimal mass above which a dying star will collapse into a black hole following a supernova. People on Earth need not be bothered anticipating such drama: for us, when the sun dies, the lights will just go out. In astrophysical terms, our sun will at that point be a stable white dwarf. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Critical Acclaim for Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar:<br></b>"Any new fact or insight that I may have found has not seemed to me as a 'discovery' of mine, but rather something that had always been there and that I had chanced to pick up. I discovered true mathematical elegance from Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar." &#x2015; Carl Sagan</p></p><h2>The Psychology of Good and Evil: Why Children, Adults, and Groups Help and Harm Others</h2><p>This book explores the roots of goodness and evil by gathering together the knowledge gained in a lifelong study of harmful or altruistic behavior. Ervin Staub has studied what leads children and adults to help others in need and how caring, helping, and altruism develop in children; bullying and youth violence and their prevention; the roots of genocide, mass killing, and other harmful behavior between groups of people; the prevention of violence; healing victimized groups and reconciliation between groups. He presents a broad panorama of the roots of violence and caring and how we create societies and a world that is caring, peaceful, and harmonious.</p><p>"Ervin Staub's timely and well-researched book combines knowledge and wisdom, challenging notions of evil, and stimulating concepts of good." Elie Wiesel, recipient of the 1986 Nobel Prize for Peace<br><br>"The Psychology of Good and Evil offers a profound scientific reflection on an urgent question for mankind: why do people act so destructively, on the one hand, or with compassion and caring on the other? Psychology rarely grapples with such compelling issues, and even more rarely with the brilliance, insight, and power of Ervin Staub. I strongly recommend his book to anyone concerned about the future of our children, and their children." Daniel Goleman, Author of Destructive Emotions and Emotional Intelligence<br><br>"Authoritative, grounded, profoundly humane: a rare opportunity to review a lifetime of important work in one book." Richard Rhodes, winner of the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction and author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Masters of Death, and Why They Kill<br><br>"Ervin Staub, like no one else, has richly informed our understanding of our human capacity for both evil and good. His life work, bred by his own experience as a Holocaust survivor, marries a scientistas mind with a humanitarianas heart. Kudos to Cambridge University Press for collecting his influential writings, together with new works, in one accessible volume." David G. Myers, Hope College, author of Intuition and The Pursuit of Happiness<br><br>"...enlightening...engaging...It is a systematic, rational, and very detailed discussion of a complex subject that is sure to help clarify the thinking of both academics and lay individuals in these uncertain times." Metapsychology Online Book Reviews<br><br>"Over the course of almost four decades, Professor Staub has made signal contributions to our understanding of why some people commit unspeakable acts, why others risk their lives to save their intended victims, and why most of us just look the other way. Professor Staub has never looked the other way, and his research and practical efforts to foster--tolerance and accelerate healing--described in this volume--stand as an inspiration to us all."

Which is a more criminal act, causing a death by dumping toxic material or by shooting a victim with a gun? Are criminals born or made? <em>Criminology: Explaining Crime and Its Context, Tenth Edition</em>, offers a broad perspective on criminological theory. It provides students of criminology and sociology with a thorough exposure to a range of theories about crime, contrasting their logic and assumptions, but also highlighting efforts to integrate and blend these frameworks. In this tenth edition, the authors have incorporated new directions that have gained traction in the field, while remaining faithful to their criminological heritage. Among the themes in this work are the relativity of crime (its changing definition) with abundant examples, historical roots of criminology and the lessons they have provided, and the strength and challenges of applying the scientific method. This revision offers new coverage of the growing problem of mental health and crime, a more tightly focused discussion of crime statistics, more global examples, and new material on human trafficking and on youth violence.&nbsp;Brown and Esbensen improve on this engaging and challenging introduction to the theory of crime and punishment, which is already perhaps the best criminology text available for undergraduates today.</p></p><p><p><strong>Stephen E.

To be human is, in part, to be physically sexed and culturally gendered. Yet not all bodies are clearly male or female. <i>Bodies in Doubt</i> traces the changing definitions, perceptions, and medical management of intersex (atypical sex development) in America from the colonial period to the present day. </p><p>From the beginning, intersex bodies have been marked as "other," as monstrous, sinister, threatening, inferior, and unfortunate. Some nineteenth-century doctors viewed their intersex patients with disrespect and suspicion. Later, doctors showed more empathy for their patients' plights and tried to make correct decisions regarding their care. Yet definitions of "correct" in matters of intersex were entangled with shifting ideas and tensions about what was natural and normal, indeed about what constituted personhood or humanity.</p><p>Reis has examined hundreds of cases of "hermaphroditism" and intersex found in medical and popular literature and argues that medical practice cannot be understood outside of the broader cultural context in which it is embedded. As the history of responses to intersex bodies has shown, doctors are influenced by social concerns about marriage and heterosexuality. <i>Bodies in Doubt</i> considers how Americans have interpreted and handled ambiguous bodies, how the criteria and the authority for judging bodies changed, how both the binary gender ideal and the anxiety over uncertainty persisted, and how the process for defining the very norms of sex and gender evolved.</p><p><i>Bodies in Doubt</i> breaks new ground in examining the historical roots of modern attitudes about intersex in the United States and will interest scholars and researchers in disability studies, social history, gender studies, and the history of medicine.</p></p><p><p><i>Bodies in Doubt </i>traces the changing definitions, perceptions, and medical management of intersex (atypical sexual development) in America from the colonial period to the present day.

Many of the images have been replaced by digital images, and there are also many new illustrations, both in the textbook and on the companion website. It provides a comprehensive guide both to the techniques used to obtain radiographs of the horse, and to radiographic interpretation. The normal radiographic anatomy of immature and mature horses is presented with normal variations, incidental findings and details of significant abnormalities. Remarks on clinical prognosis and treatment are also included. The text has been updated to include new information, knowledge gained from continued clinical experience and the most relevant references from recent literature. The emphasis throughout is on practical tips, common pitfalls, and the techniques used to obtain the best radiographs of specific areas and conditions.</p> <p>The fourth edition has been completely updated and now fully reflects the move to digital imaging. Additional changes to this edition include major revisions to the chapters on the head, thorax, and abdomen; expansion of and division into three chapters for the foot, pastern, and fetlock; and further reading lists organised under sub-headings for ease of reference.

A systematic guide to constructing RFPs that encourage productive, useful vendor responses -- and avoiding the common pitfalls of RFP development. Detailed example language, analysis tools, and practical resources for jumpstarting RFP development. An invaluable resource for everyone creating RFPs in business or government for any purchase. When done right, RFPs enable businesses and government agencies to fairly evaluate competing proposals while reviewing the broadest possible range of potential solutions. All too often, however, RFPs fail to meet these goals, because their creators simply dont understand how to create them effectively. In this book, the worlds leading RFP consultant offers realistic, specific, start-to-finish guidance for every professional called upon to write RFPs. Bud Porter-Roth covers every step of the RFP process, offering specific language examples that demonstrate both best practices and worst practices to avoid. He shows how to ensure that RFPs contain information that is sufficiently accurate and detailed; how to ensure clarity of presentation, structure, and organization that encourages productive responses; and how to avoid the most common pitfalls of the RFP process. The book includes detailed coverage of writing each section of the typical RFP, including administrative, technical, management, pricing, and evaluation sections; as well as extensive practical guidance on planning and preparation. Appendices present complete RFP examples, preparation instructions, analysis tools, calendars, and other resources for jumpstarting RFP development.</p><p><p> <b>Praise for <i>Request for Proposal</i> </b> </p><p> &#x201c;Bud Porter-Roth is an expert in the field of preparing RFPs, and we could not have successfully completed our project without his skill and knowledge.

Rather than pure expository text, the book features dialogue to demonstrate how group dynamics unfold.&nbsp;<br> <br> Early chapters describe the importance of groups and teams, and how communication is integral to these social forms. The book then describes and explains the core processes for which each group member is responsible, such as sharing information and managing conflict. The final chapter guides students through participating in, navigating, and facilitating group interactions. The book uses a wide range of group types &#x2013; such as student problem-solving groups, organizational work teams, health care teams, family groups, community groups, and sports teams &#x2013; to illustrate concepts and present skills grounded in research and theory.&nbsp;<br> <br> Each chapter includes a &#x201c;Theory Stand-out&#x201d; that closely examines the theory-research link, a message and meaning section that analyzes transcripts of authentic interactions, and skill-building exercises and activities that allow students to apply what they are learning. Successfully combining both academic and real-world understandings of communication, and featuring engaging content and examples, the book is ideal for communication courses, particularly those with business applications.</p><p><strong>Joann Keyton</strong>&nbsp;earned her Ph.D. in communication and business administration at The Ohio State University.

And what can we do about it?<br><br>These are the questions that a group of classroom teachers set out to explore. Over the course of seven years, a group of middle, high school, college, and university teachers participated in a federally funded writing coalition project to implement innovative approaches to teaching writing. Together they developed this series of lesson plans designed to make writing both fun and an integral part of diverse curricula. <br><br>"Practical" is the recurrent motif of each teaching strategy. Developed by real teachers in real classrooms, the lessons are grouped into seven categories: writing process, portfolios, literature, research, grammar, writing on demand, and media.<br><br>Each lesson follows a standard format that includes purpose of the activity; necessary preparation; required props and materials; process and procedure for implementation; instructional pointers and/or possible pitfalls; and reflections from the teacher that provide "behind the scenes" insights.</p><p></p><h2>North American Cambridge Latin Course Unit 4 Student&#39;s Book</h2><p>Developed by the University of Cambridge School Classics Project, this bestselling Latin program provides an enjoyable and carefully paced introduction to the Latin language, complemented by background information on Roman culture and civilization.

Most of these essentials relate to the semantics, or meaning, of program elements, and the text uses interpreters (short programs that directly analyze an abstract representation of the program text) to express the semantics of many essential language elements in a way that is both clear and executable. The approach is both analytical and hands-on. The book provides views of programming languages using widely varying levels of abstraction, maintaining a clear connection between the high-level and low-level views. Exercises are a vital part of the text and are scattered throughout; the text explains the key concepts, and the exercises explore alternative designs and other issues. The complete Scheme code for all the interpreters and analyzers in the book can be found online through The MIT Press web site. For this new edition, each chapter has been revised and many new exercises have been added. Significant additions have been made to the text, including completely new chapters on modules and continuation-passing style. <i>Essentials of Programming Languages</i> can be used for both graduate and undergraduate courses, and for continuing education courses for programmers.</p></p><p>Daniel P.

Washington, W.E.B. Du Bois, and the Struggle for Racial Uplift (The African American Experience Series)</h2><p>The beginning of the twentieth century was a critical time in African-American history. Segregation and discrimination were on the rise. Two seminal African American figures began to debate on ways to combat racial problems. Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois developed different strategies for racial uplift as they actively competed for the support of the black community. In the process, Washington and Du Bois made a permanent mark on the debate over how blacks should achieve equality in America.<br><br>Although other books address the Washington&#x2013;Du Bois conflict, this text provides a detailed overview of the issues in a brief yet thorough narrative, giving students a clear understanding of these two influential leaders. Jacqueline Moore incorporates the latest scholarship as she examines the motivations of Washington and Du Bois and the political issues surrounding their positions. Accompanying documents allow students to see actual evidence on the issues.<br><br>Moore contextualizes the debate in the broader terms of radical versus accommodationist strategies of racial uplift.<br><br>Washington&#x2014;an accommodationist&#x2014;believed economic independence was most important to racial equality. W.E.B. Du Bois adopted more radical strategies, arguing that social and political equality&#x2014;not just economic opportunity&#x2014;were essential to racial uplift.<br><br>This book traces the argument between these two men, which became public in 1903 when Du Bois published The Souls of Black Folk, which included an attack on Washington, his association with Tuskegee Institute's industrial education program, and accommodationism. The clash between Du Bois and Washington escalated over the next 12 years.<br><br>Du Bois was a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), an organization that often opposed Washington's gradualist approach. Although the NAACP became the major civil rights organization after Washington's death in 1915, the same issues Washington and DuBois debated surfaced in the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, and the debate raged once again between accommodationists and radicals. In time, both men's ideals faded until the same issues surfaced again in the 1960s, and the debate raged once again between accommodationists and radicals within the Civil Rights Movement.<br><br>Booker T.

Moore's narrative and accompanying documents underscore the complexity of the ideological conflict between Washington and Du Bois. Her book will empower students to analyze the issues and enable them to draw their own conclusions. This is an excellent teaching tool. (John David Smith, professor, The University of North Carolina at Charlotte; author of Black Judas)<br><br>This is the first book of its kind. It will work nicely as a supplementary text for American and African American history courses as well as for African American and Black Studies courses. The added dimension of the documents brings a human face to the debate over racial uplift between Washington and Du Bois, allowing readers to feel like active participants in the debate. (Wilbert Jenkins, Temple University, author of Climbing Up to Glory)<br><br>This sensitive, balanced, and amazingly comprehensive study provides rich insight into the ideas, methods, and motives of two remarkable men whose influence is still evident in discussions of racial uplift strategies in the twenty-first century. Written in lean, graceful prose, it places the Washington&#x2013;Du Bois struggle in a broad historical context and explains how differences in the origins, experiences, and personalities of the two men shaped their disparate approaches to racial uplift. By any standard this is a first-rate book, one that deftly probes beneath the surface of the public debate to reveal the complexity of the struggle between black America's most influential power broker and its most renowned intellectual. In addition to appealing to both specialists and general readers, this book can be used with great profit in the classroom. (Willard B.

The purpose of the centers is to promote the teaching of the ancient science of yoga. There are twenty-five Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centers and Ashrams, with many other affiliated centers and teachers around the world.<b>From the Introduction</b><p>"Shortly after I began taking classes at the Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Center in America, I read The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga by Swami Vishnu-devananda. Much of it was eye-opening to me, especially the chapter on the "Natural Diet of Man" (which I assumed included women). I was astonished that the concept of not eating meat had never crossed my mind. I had never met a vegetarian nor heard of vegetarianism -- this was 1962 America.</p><p>"One day my mother decided to cook a special treat. She bought some lobsters, filled the bathtub with water so they could await their fate in comfort, and put a big pot of water on to boil. As the live lobsters were dropped into the boiling water, I heard their screams. The thought crossed my mind, 'How could I cause such unspeakable suffering to my fellow beings, just because I liked the taste of their flesh?' I understood firsthand the yogic principle of ahimsa (non-violence) and never ate meat nor fish again."</p><p><i>Swami Saradananda</i></p><p>The recipes in this book are in accord with the ancient philosophy of Yoga and Vedanta -- the nondualistic philosophy that forms the metaphysical basis of yoga. Yoga prescribes a lactovegetarian diet for health and moral and spiritual reasons. This diet is an essential part of yoga, as it promotes a wellness that allows the rest of the discipline to proceed unhampered. A yogic diet is in itself a discipline of both body and mind, and is in accord with the spiritual principle of reverence for life, expressed as ahimsa.</p><p>Annamaya kosha (the physical body) is made of food. Our whole life can be seen as the effect of the interaction of food and life, or matter and energy, which are respectively food and the eater of food. Food is converted into energy, and energy uses food. Food is the door to a healthier life. It helps keep one free of bodily problems so the mind can concentrate and the spirit can grow. The process of cooking is a good discipline. It involves giving to others, organization, and frequently learning to work under pressure while staying calm. It also encourages cleanliness, imagination and responsibility. The yogic diet consists of pure vegetarian food freshly prepared with love. Perhaps as you achieve a proper, healthy diet you will be encouraged to tackle the other four principles of yoga -- exercise; breathing; relaxation; and positive thinking and meditation. Even if you are interested only in the physical yoga exercises, you will be surprised by the enhancement of your practice as you modify your diet.</p><p><b>The Three Gunas</b></p><p>"Verily, this person consists of the essence of food."</p><p><i>Taittiriya Upanishad, II. 1</i></p><p>In yogic philosophy, the mind is formed from the subtlest portion or essence of food. If the food taken in is pure, the mind has the proper building materials for the development of a strong and subtle intellect and a good memory. A yogic diet brings inner peace to the body and mind and encourages spiritual progress.</p><p>All of Nature, including our diet, is categorized into three qualities, or Gunas: sattvic (pure), rajasic (overstimulating), and tamasic (putrified). A person's mental makeup may be judged from the type of food he or she prefers to eat. Yogis believe not only that "you are what you eat," but also you eat those foods that reflect your own level of mental and spiritual purity. As your life changes in a positive way, you will also see your food preferences improving. The yogic diet is based on sattvic foods.</p><p><b>Sattvic Foods</b></p><p>"The foods which increase life, purity, strength, health, joy, and cheerfulness, which are savory and oleaginous, substantial and agreeable, are dear to the sattvic people."</p><p><i>Bhagavad Gita, XVII. 8</i></p><p>Pure foods that increase vitality, energy, vigor, health, and joy, that are delicious, wholesome, substantial, and agreeable are sattvic. These foods render the mind pure and calm and generate equanimity, poise and peaceful tendencies. Sattvic foods supply maximum energy, increase strength and endurance, and help to eliminate fatigue even for those who do strenuous work. They promote a peaceful attitude and are conducive to the practice of meditation.</p><p>Foods should be as fresh and natural as possible, preferably organically grown, not genetically modified, and kept without preservatives or artificial flavorings. They should also be eaten in as natural a state as possible -- either raw, steamed, or cooked lightly.</p><p>Sattvic foods include:</p><p><b>Grains</b> such as corn, barley, wheat, unpolished rice, oat, millet, and quinoa. Make sure you include in your diet coarse foods such as steel-cut oats and whole grain breads. These are good for the teeth and jaws, and they stimulate the processes of digestion and elimination. Grains supply necessary carbohydrates, the main source of energy for the body, and they also contain about half the amino acids that are needed to form protein.</p><p><b>Protein foods</b> such as legumes, nuts, and seeds. Proteins are the "building blocks" of the body. The key to a healthy vegetarian diet is to eat a good mixture of foods to make sure it includes all the amino acids essential for making proteins.</p><p><b>Fruits,</b> both fresh and dried, as well as pure fruit juices, provided the ancient diet of the rishis and raja yogis. Among the many different foods, fruits stand foremost in importance in the yogis' menu or regime. The curative effects of fresh juicy fruits are astonishing. They fill the body with vitalizing, or life-giving, minerals and vitamins, and roughage (fiber). They contain alkaline matter that helps to keep the blood pure.</p><p><b>Vegetables</b> are important in the diet because they contain minerals, vitamins, and fiber. The diet should include seeded vegetables (such as cucumbers and squashes), all leafy vegetables, and roots or tubers. These are best eaten raw or cooked as lightly as possible.</p><p><b>Herbs</b> for seasoning and herbal teas.</p><p><b>Natural sweeteners,</b> such as honey, molasses, maple syrup, and apple juice concentrate, are much better for you than processed sugar. Raw sugar is a traditional part of yogic diets in India, where, known as jaggery, it comes directly from the cane and is not processed. White sugar is best avoided in a healthy diet.</p><p><b>Dairy products,</b> such as milk, butter, cheese, and yogurt, are traditionally an essential part of the yogic diet. However, modern dairy practices abuse the animals, filling their milk with hormones and antibiotics. We have, therefore, also suggested a vegan alternative for recipes, whenever possible. Even if you choose to use dairy products, we recommend you do so in moderation. They tend to intensify the production of mucus, which interferes with the natural flow of breath.</p><p><b>Rajasic Foods</b></p><p>"Foods that are bitter, sour, saline, excessively hot, pungent, dry, and burning, are liked by the Rajasic and are productive of pain, grief, and disease."</p><p><i>Bhagavad Gita, XVII. 9</i></p><p>The yogic diet avoids rajasic foods because they overstimulate the body and mind. They excite passions and boisterous tendencies, cause physical and mental stress, bring a restless state of mind, and destroy the mind-body balance that is essential for happiness. However, remember this division of foods into sattvic-rajasic-tamasic is a comparative one, not an absolute. It is meant to help you gain the insight to change your diet in a positive direction. Hence, spices are used in recipes, but they are used subtly and may be phased out as your tastes become "sattvic."</p><p>Onions, garlic, radishes, coffee, tea, tobacco, and stimulants of all kind fall into this category -- also, heavily spiced and salted, chemical-riddled convenience foods and snacks. Sattvic food taken in the wrong place, such as "on the run," becomes rajasic. Refined (white) sugar, soft drinks, prepared mustards, pungent spices, highly seasoned foods, and anything excessively hot, bitter, sour, or saline are all rajasic and are best avoided.</p><p>Strong spices and condiments overstimulate the mind as well as irritate the mucus membrane of the intestines. Rajasic foods accentuate lust, anger, greed, selfishness, violence, and egoism, which are the barriers that separate people from each other and from their realization of the Divine. Rajas is the energy that creates dissension in life and wars in the world.</p><p><b>Tamasic Foods</b></p><p>"That food which is stale, tasteless, putrid, rotten, and impure refuse, is the food liked by the Tamasic."</p><p><i>Bhagavad Gita, XVII. 10</i></p><p>Tamasic food makes a person dull, inert, and lazy; it robs individuals of high ideals, purpose, and motivation. In addition, it accentuates the tendency to suffer from chronic ailments and depression, and fills the minds with darkness, anger, and impure thoughts. Abandoning tamasic foods needs to be among the first positive lifestyle changes you make.</p><p>Meat, fish, eggs, all intoxicants, alcoholic beverages, marijuana, and opium are tamasic in nature. Meat-eating and alcoholism are closely allied. The craving for alcohol dies a natural death when meat is withdrawn from the diet.</p><p>Tamasic foods include all foods that are stale, rotten, decomposed, unclean, as well as overripe and unripe fruits. Also included are foods that have been fermented, burned, fried, barbecued, or reheated many times: half-cooked, overcooked, and twice-cooked items, as well as stale products and those containing preservatives, for example canned, processed, and many prepared foods.</p><p>Mushrooms are included in this category, because they grow in the darkness. Also vinegar, because it is a product of fermentation and retards digestion.</p><p>Deep-fried foods are indigestible. The fat penetrates into them and the digestive juice of the stomach cannot act on them. The fine nutritive essence which is beneficial to health is destroyed by frying and the food takes on the quality of tamas.</p><p>Sattvic food taken in excessive quantity (overeating) becomes tamasic.</p><p><b>Guidelines for Healthy Eating</b></p><p>"From food all beings are born. Having been born, they grow by food. Food is eaten by all beings and it also eats them."</p><p><i>Taittiriya Upanishad, II. 2. 1</i></p><p>We go on in th...</p></p><h2>Succubus Revealed (Georgina Kincaid, Book 6)</h2><p>In Georgina Kincaid, succubus and she-demon, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Richelle Mead has created one of her most enticing characters.

But Evan is greeting his son, Dean, fourteen years late. The boy had been shuttled secretly to another city, along with his teenaged mother, while still a newborn. Now his mother has passed away, and Evan is it&#x2014;Dad. An instant single parent. <br> &nbsp;<br> Evan was once lead guitarist for a hot band with a hit single; now 31, he gets by as a guitar instructor to middle-aged guys, and does menial work in a music shop. With Dean in the picture he has to change fast, which means facing up to the past, to his own father, and to the epilepsy that haunts him and threatens his every moment.</p><p><b>Garth Stein</b> is the author of two other novels, the worldwide bestseller <i>The Art of Racing in the Rain</i>, now published in 30 languages, and <i>Raven Stole the Moon</i>, as well as a play, <i>Brother Jones</i>.<i> </i>He lives in Seattle with his wife, three sons, and their dog, Comet.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>Maybe a little reflection at this point in Evan&#x2019;s life isn&#x2019;t a bad thing. A gathering of mourners on a hill at a cemetery outside Walla Walla, a good five-hour drive from Seattle. A hot morning under an intense and brilliant sky. A dead girl in a box, suspended over a hole dug in the fertile soil. And Evan, watching from a distance like a father gazing through a nursery window at his newly born son, whose cries go unheard, untended, a helpless flail of tiny arms and legs and a little mouth that is open in silent scream, all of it safe from Evan&#x2019;s unsanitary touch.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hikes up the hill and takes his place among the circle of attendees. They are all the same: pale complexions, downcast eyes; a wash of chalky faces. There are fewer than he&#x2019;d hoped. Twenty at most. He&#x2019;d been warned that the burial service would be small, reserved for family and the closest of friends. Still, he&#x2019;d envisioned a pack into which he could fade. After all, Mormons tend to stick together; they like to travel in groups.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shifts uncomfortably. He has nowhere to hide. They are looking at him. Not directly, not staring. They are sneaking peeks, stealing sideways glances from behind flapping paper fans. They have no idea who he is; they don&#x2019;t seem to care. A man speaks a few elegiac words that are swallowed by the breeze, tossed around and thrown over his shoulder for no one to hear.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan recognizes Tracy&#x2019;s mother and father. He remembers her brother, Brad, one of those high school peers who fell somewhere between friend and acquaintance. Around them stand several of Tracy&#x2019;s older siblings. He doesn&#x2019;t know them, couldn&#x2019;t recall their names if called upon to do so. Three or four or five brothers and sisters who were already grown and were never around when Tracy was a teenager; shards of a fractured family. And there is another important family member present: Tracy&#x2019;s son.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan doesn&#x2019;t recognize Dean, but he knows well enough who he is. A young man, fourteen-years-old, who, like Evan, stands out from the crowd, his dark hair hacked short, his face alert and defensive.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean looks up and meets Evan&#x2019;s eyes. He looks at Evan without suspicion. But why would he suspect? What could he think, other than that Evan was another from Grandpa&#x2019;s congregation, come late for the passing of Tracy Smith? But he is curious about something, for he doesn&#x2019;t look away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracy&#x2019;s father places his arm around Dean&#x2019;s shoulders, a gesture of comfort. Dean shifts slightly, stiffens a little bit, not dramatically, but enough to indicate that the gesture is not welcome. Enough so that Tracy&#x2019;s father withdraws his arm. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in an instant, Evan knows Dean. He knows what is going on. For Dean to have to witness his mother&#x2019;s burial is bad enough, but for him to be so uncomfortable with his fellow grievers that he cannot grieve himself is crushing. Evan remembers his own grandfather&#x2019;s funeral, watching the people cry. He felt so separate from them. They may have been friends with his grandfather for a long time, but they didn&#x2019;t really know him. Not like Evan did. And so he couldn&#x2019;t join them. He could only get through it and then grieve later, when he was alone, when it really mattered, as, he knows, Dean will grieve for his mother later. Until then, Dean stands, stoically, guarded, comforting no one, allowing no one to comfort him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan&#x2019;s mind drifts from the scene; the tentacles of his attention are caught by the breeze and gently sway toward the land around him. He hears the combines grinding away in the distance, whirling their razor-sharp blades as fast as they can, slicing at the dry stalks of winter wheat. It is mid-July and the harvest season is upon Walla Walla. He can feel the trucks, heavy on the highway; he can envision the people in town walking with a bounce to their step. He knows that this is what they wait for every year, to gather up the fruit of the earth and revel in its bounty. We are in the days of plenty. The fruits and vegetables and grains allow us to grow and prosper. All partake of the cornucopia. Save for Tracy Smith, whose body, now released from its earthly commitment, is being returned to the soil from which it sprang.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan snaps himself back into the frame; he attends to what is before him, the burial of his ex-girlfriend. He scrapes his teeth against his lower lip, scratching an itch that is not really there but somewhere in his brain. A seizure? Is one coming? No, no. The heat, the long drive. It&#x2019;s fatigue, not a seizure. It had better not be a seizure. Not here. It would be too ironic for him to come down with a case of the falling sickness at Tracy&#x2019;s funeral when he was trying to be as inconspicuous as possible. It would be almost funny to have twenty or more Mormons stand over his convulsing limbs, questioning in breathless voices: <i>Who is he? What is he doing? Why is he here? </i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The service ends. Mourners amble back to their cars. Evan wonders what is next for him. He has seen the remains of Tracy properly attended to, and he has seen Dean, his child, now grown. What else is there to do but to return to his car and make the fivehour drive back to Seattle, take his place again in his life and wonder, as he always has, what was to become of Dean, the Boy Wonder, whom Evan has never met.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You came. I&#x2019;m shocked.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan turns. Tracy&#x2019;s brother, Brad, stands directly in front of him, not more than two feet away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one who&#x2014;&#x201d; Evan starts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Called you,&#x201d; Brad finishes for him. &#x201c;I know I did. My father would kill me if he knew. Don&#x2019;t tell him.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You must feel guilty as hell,&#x201d; Brad says, and as he says it, he sticks out a long finger and tries to jab Evan in the chest; Evan, quickness being one of his assets, takes a step back and out of range.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Dean&#x2019;s father?&#x201d; Evan asks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking at him, stupid,&#x201d; Brad replies.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;His <i>step</i>father,&#x201d; Evan clarifies.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brad laughs a quick snort. &#x201c;How have you been, Evan?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan shrugs. He was kind of hoping for a real answer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I heard that song of yours on the radio,&#x201d; Brad continues. &#x201c;About ten years ago.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Eleven.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I never could find the album, though. It must not have been that big.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It was big enough,&#x201d; Evan says, an edge creeping into his voice.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Really? Ever think of sharing any of the money you made with Tracy and Dean?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she was the one who abandoned him, remember. He had wanted to keep the baby. She was the one who left Seattle. She was the one who stole away in the middle of the night.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I gotta go, man,&#x201d; Brad says, &#x201c;my diplomatic immunity is about to wear off.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It means what it means. What do you think it means. I&#x2019;ll see you, man. Good luck.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brad starts to leave.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Give me your number,&#x201d; Evan says quickly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you a call. I want to know what&#x2019;s going on with you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nah,&#x201d; Brad grins, &#x201c;you know everything you need to know about me, Evan. I&#x2019;m just like you, man, still fighting the good fight, you know?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he&#x2019;s gone. All around, black-clad bodies murmur down the hill toward their cars.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan spies Tracy&#x2019;s mother, Ellen, who is being consoled by another woman. His first impression is that she looks old. When Evan first met her, he was only fourteen and she&#x2014;but a child herself when Tracy was born&#x2014;was thirty-six. That was seventeen years ago. Evan is now thirty-one, Ellen fifty-three. And while the seventeen years has hardly changed Evan&#x2014;he is still boyish and almost beardless&#x2014;those same years have taken a different toll on Ellen Smith. Her face is etched with deep wrinkles. Her hair is dull brown with streaks of gray. Her blue eyes are pale.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hello, Mrs. Smith,&#x201d; he calls out, approaching the women. Ellen&#x2019;s friend excuses herself; Ellen looks toward Evan blankly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Evan,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Wallace.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn&#x2019;t respond. Why would she? She hated him, back when he and Tracy were high school sweethearts. She and her thickly muscled husband, Frank. They both hated him. So what should he say to her now? Should he accuse her, and by accusing her make it clear that he feels the magnitude of her actions?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Evan?&#x201d; she asks, the mist clearing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry about Tracy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How is Dean?&#x201d; he asks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh! Dean&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan nods. &#x201c;He looks good. Healthy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He is,&#x201d; Ellen smiles painfully. &#x201c;What are you doing here?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan shifts his weight from one foot to the other.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to meet him,&#x201d; he says.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ellen looks quickly over her shoulder and down the hill to where people are climbing into their hot cars and driving off. A small group lingers near two black limousines. Frank is among them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe that would be in his best interest. Not now, anyway.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan cocks his head, unsure how to take her response. But it doesn&#x2019;t matter. Before he can think about it long, his request is granted. Without warning, Dean is standing beside Ellen as if Evan had made a wish.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean. The Boy Wonder. So close now, so near, Evan feels his pulse quicken. What is it about Dean? His presence is almost intoxicating. His long, thin limbs draped in a black suit, his collar too large for his neck, his navy-blue tie knotted in an old-fashioned style quite beyond Evan&#x2019;s sartorial expertise. So casually he hangs his arm around Ellen&#x2019;s neck and rests his head on her shoulder, turning slightly toward Evan, his green eyes blaring out from their sockets, screaming at Evan that I am yours, yes, I am of you, yes I am.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hot, Grandma,&#x201d; the young man complains.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This is an old friend of your mother&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Ellen says deliberately, almost forcing herself to say it, pushing through her misgivings. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s come from Seattle to pay his respects.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean unhooks his arm and offers his hand to Evan, which Evan takes, awed, in a way, by such self-control, such a display of courtesy in the face of such real grief.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m terribly sorry about your mother,&#x201d; Evan mumbles. He&#x2019;s caught off guard. The new sensation of Dean&#x2019;s hand in his own, the feelings rushing through his body, his nerves sending confused signals to his brain, that not only is he holding a hand, shaking a hand, but that it is a hand that belongs to his own flesh and blood, his own son.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Dean responds evenly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan doesn&#x2019;t let go; he holds on and they stay like that, hand-in-hand, for several moments.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We have to go, Evan,&#x201d; Ellen breaks in. &#x201c;The reception.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again she looks down toward Frank, who is in the parking lot staring up at them with piercing eyes. Evan has always been afraid of Frank Smith, a stocky man who wears his gray hair tightly shorn. His neck is thick with ropes of muscles that disappear into the collar of his shirt. His nose was flattened&#x2014;Tracy once told Evan&#x2014;from years of boxing while in the Marines. He has little hands that he clenches into fists of calloused and scarred flesh that appear to be made of clay. He speaks not like an average man, but like a little Moses, a man of God, a man who carries lightning in his arms and breathes the flames of Righteousness. He is not one to be challenged.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan releases Dean&#x2019;s hand; Ellen nudges Dean to start down the hill, which he does. She does not immediately follow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t interfere,&#x201d; she whispers at Evan. &#x201c;Not after all this time.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Please, Evan. I don&#x2019;t know why you&#x2019;re here. But please don&#x2019;t interfere. Not after all this time.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turns and hurries after Dean, catches him, and then ushers him to the bottom of the hill. When they arrive, Frank directs them into one of the limousines, waves his arm to those still standing by, who obediently climb into their vehicles, and they all drive off, leaving Evan alone at Tracy&#x2019;s grave.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evan cannot move. He stands silent for several minutes, long after the last black car has left. What happened? He was so young when it all occurred. A sperm and an egg met, cells began to multiply and divide, and a child was born. But then what? What<br>became of Evan? What became of his son? It&#x2019;s all so murky, the circumstances so obscure that he doesn&#x2019;t even remember how the story goes, or whose story he really believes. The truth belongs to he who tells it, so what good is it, anyway?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He starts back down the hill toward his car. His steps fall heavily against the hard-packed dirt path, and he raises his eyes to the surrounding land; the harvesting machines continue to work over the amber hills, threshing the wheat that has grown all spring, plowing an ever-widening swath of brown through the endless golden fields.</p><h2>Rough Notes: dancing about architecture (The Road Series)</h2><p>NEW EDITION WITH LOADS OF EXTRA IMAGES!! Bruce Thomas was prompted to write Rough Notes when a friend told him: &#x2018;There&#x2019;s only one history of rock ...and pop and you were there!&#x2019; It follows his career from the paper-round he did to buy his first guitar and see the Beatles &#x2014; all the way through to his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 ...and beyond. He recalls his time as bass player with Elvis Costello and the Attractions &#x2014; setting the record straight on the so-called feud between him and the singer &#x2014; and includes accounts of working with Paul McCartney, touring on Elton John&#x2019;s private jet, a day at Johnny Cash&#x2019;s ranch and dinner with Yoko Ono &#x2014; as well as encounters with Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Abba, Howling Wolf, John Lee Hooker, Mick Jagger, Jimmy Page, the Who, Freddie Mercury, Pink Floyd, Rod Stewart, Neil Young, Eric Clapton, John Belushi, Michael Hutchence ...and a certain Jimmy Savile. Yet Rough Notes is far more than a personal memoir or catalogue of trivia. It traces the entire story of rock and pop from its beginnings in the 1950s, right through to the present day &#x2014; despite the fact it&#x2019;s been said that ...&#x2019;writing about music is like dancing about architecture&#x2019;.</p><p>Bruce Thomas is best-known as the former bass player with Elvis Costello and the Attractions and as the writer of the best-selling biogrpahy of Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit. As a session-musican he played on many hit records -- and trained in the martial art of Body, Mind and Spirit kung fu.</p><h2>The Static Universe: Exploding the Myth of Cosmic Expansion</h2><p>"The Static Universe" is an anthem for the growing number of skywatchers who are heartily sick and tired of being led up the garden path. Is the Universe expanding? Maverick astrophysicist Hilton Ratcliffe, author of the highly controversial book "The Virtue of Heresy",&nbsp;argues that it is not, and if he's right, an entire body of science is brought to its knees. The impact of the ensuing catastrophe will be devastating, and the cost to those who doggedly defend the prevailing paradigm is inestimable. It certainly runs to billions of dollars. In a world where self-interest rules, the author of this shocking expos is literally putting himself on the line.

This, I submit, is precisely what should not be done.

He is a member of both the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa (ASSA) and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. He is prominently opposed to the stranglehold that Big Bang Theory has on astronomical research and funding, and to this end became a founding member of the Alternative Cosmol-ogy Group (an association of some 700 leading scientists from all corners of the globe), which conducted its inaugural international conference in Portugal in 2005. He is an active member of the organisational, scientific, and proceedings committees for the second ACG conference, which was held in the USA in September 2008. Hilton has been fre-quently interviewed in the press, radio, and television, and has authored a number of papers for scientific journals, books, and conferences. He writes a monthly astrophysical column for Ndaba, the Durban Centre newsletter of the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa, and is editor of the ACG newsletter. He serves as consulting astrophysicist on the steering committee of the Durban Space Science Centre and Planetarium, a project of the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa (Durban Centre). Hilton Ratcliffe is best known in formal science as co-discoverer, to-gether with eminent nuclear chemist Oliver Manuel and solar physicist Michael Mozina, of the CNO nuclear fusion cycle on the surface of the Sun, nearly 70 years after it was first predicted. In his capacity as a Fellow of the (British) Institute of Physics, he involves himself in addressing the decline in student interest in physical sciences at both high school and university level, and particularly likes to encourage the reading of books.

Obtaining maturity in Christ is a theme that runs throughout the work, and St Paul&#39;s admonition to &#39;... come to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ&#39; (Eph 4:13) appropriately describes the tone of the book. Mother Raphaela assesses and addresses all the failings and spiritual detours that keep us from having the character of our Lord Jesus Christ everything from false piety to heads swollen with knowledge. She also emphasizes the molding of character within community, where rough edges and prideful independence are transformed into graciousness and service to the neighbor.

Shortages, along with resulting price increases, threaten industrialized civilization, the global economy, and our entire way of life.</p> <p>In <em>Confronting Collapse</em>, author Michael C. Ruppert, a former LAPD narcotics officer turned investigative journalist, details the intricate connections between money and energy, including the ways in which oil shortages and price spikes triggered the economic crash that began in September 2008. Given the 96 percent correlation between economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions and the unlikelihood of economic growth without a spike in energy use, Ruppert argues that we are not, in fact, on the verge of economic recovery, but on the verge of complete collapse.</p> <p>Ruppert's truth is not merely inconvenient. It is utterly devastating.</p> <p>But there is still hope. Ruppert outlines a 25-point plan of action, including the creation of a second strategic petroleum reserve for the use of state and local governments, the immediate implementation of a national Feed-in Tariff mandating that electric utilities pay 3 percent above market rates for all surplus electricity generated from renewable sources, a thorough assessment of soil conditions nationwide, and an emergency action plan for soil restoration and sustainable agriculture.</p></p><p><p>Michael C.

And, sometimes I remind him, in a way that only a friend can, that my perspective is colored by my own distinct experiences as an informed woman of color in the United States. And frankly, that means that some of what is between these covers makes me cringe; but it is exactly this substance, actively suppressed in proposed national and international gatherings, that we human beings must debate and resolve, or else, we will find Dr. King's admonition, once again, to be true: "We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools."

An award-winning quilter, she currently leads a monthly quilt club at Cabbage Rose Quilting and Fabrics in Forth Worth, Texas. Carol and her husband John live in Arlington, Texas, and have a son, Jim, daughter-in-law, Pon, granddaughter, Clarrisa, and two cats.<br> <br> As a child, learning to sew on her two grandmothers' treadle sewing machines, Betsy fell in love with fabric and quilts. In 1980, she received a B.A. in History from the University of Texas in Arlington and taught herself to quilt after receiving a quilt top made by a great aunt and great grandmother. This began a passionate journey combining her love of fabric, quiltmaking and history.<br> <br> A former quilt shop owner, Betsy has taught quiltmaking at a number of quilt shops since 1990 and she has traveled across Texas, sharing her love of 19th-century quilts through lectures, trunk shows, and workshops since 2004. She leads a monthly club at Lone Star House of Quilts in Arlington, Texas. In 2010, Betsy's first reproduction fabric l ine was printed with Blue Hill Fabrics and a second in 2011.<br> <br> In addition to quilting, Betsy enjoys cooking, antiquing, and collecting antique quilts.

It has been praised by <i>Bon Appetit</i>, <i>Food &amp; Wine</i>, and <i>Gourmet</i>, and many more. <p></p>Lynch's cuisine is all the more remarkable because it is self-taught. In a story straight out of <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, she grew up in the turbulent projects of "Southie", where petty crime was the only viable way to make a living. But in a home ec class in high school, she discovered her passion. Through a mix of hunger for knowledge, hard work, and raw smarts, she gradually created her own distinctive style of cooking, mining Italian and French classics for ideas and seasoning them with imagination.<p></p> The 150 recipes in <i>Stir</i> combine sophistication with practicality. Appetizers like baked tomatoes and cheese and crisp, buttery brioche pizzas. Dozens of the artful pastas Lynch is famous for, such as little lasagnas with chicken meatballs, and potato gnocchi with peas and mushrooms. Lobster rolls with aoli. Chicken wrapped in prosciutto and stuffed with melting Italian cheese. Creamy vanilla bread pudding with caramel sauce. Accompanied by Lynch's forthright opinions and stunning four-color photographs, these dishes will create a stir on home tables.<br> <br> <br> <p> <b>Amazon Exclusive: A Letter from Barbara Lynch</b></p><p></p> Dear Amazon Reader,<p></p> <p></p> Growing up in public housing in a tough neighborhood in Boston, I couldn't afford culinary school. Cookbooks like Waverly Root's <i>The Food of Italy</i> not only taught me about new ingredients and techniques but were an escape. (They also helped me bluff my way through my first cooking job.) Now I get to do what I love best: making people happy by feeding them really delicious food. <p></p> In <i>Stir</i>, I share my passion and my hard-earned knowledge. And of course, I give you my recipes, which the regulars in my restaurants have been clamoring for over the years. Some are almost embarrassingly easy, like Gorgonzola Fondue, Baked Cheese and Tomatoes, and Slow-Roasted Beef Tenderloin with Thyme. Others are a little more involved but oh-so-worth-it, like Chicken and Vegetable Soup with Caraway Gnocchi. There's plenty of weekday cooking, including Green Bean and Seared Shrimp Salad with Spicy Curry Sauce, which I eat all the time, and Lemony Breaded Chicken Cutlets, which my daughter Marchesa loves. <p></p> Then there are my pastas, which are my very favorite things, such as Chicken Meatball Lasagnettes (a favorite of Julia Child's) and sauces that pair well with both fresh and dried pasta, such as my signature Bolognese (I share my secret ingredient).<p></p> All of my recipes are written with the home cook in mind and so are full of the details that make a difference. I hope <i>Stir</i> will inspire you.<p></p> Enjoy!<br><br> <i>Barbara Lynch</i><p></p> <p>(Photo � Justin Ide)</p> <br> <br> <p> <b>Recipe Excerpts from <i>Stir</i></b> </p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br> Roasted Fennel and Green Beans </td> <td> <br> Butcher Shop Bolognese </td> <td> <br> Creamy Vanilla Bread Pudding </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <br><br>BARBARA LYNCH is the James Beard Award&#x2013;winning chef-owner of Barbara Lynch Gruppo, which includes seven restaurants and food businesses in Boston: No. Nine Park, B &amp; G Oyster, The Butcher Shop, Sportello, Plum, Drink, and Stir.</p><h2>The Magical Treatise of Solomon or Hygromanteia: The Ancestor of the Key of Solomon</h2><p>The Magical Treatise of Solomon or Hygromanteia is the true ancestor of the grimoire The Key of Solomon. This book has been translated from every available manuscript of the text dating from 1440. It provides much additional information on the methods of evoking spirits, and includes much background material which did not make it into The Key of Solomon. As such it is an invaluable text for both the scholar and the serious practitioner. This is a ground breaking work, and the first time the Magical Treatise has been translated into English. Contrary to popular opinion the Key of Solomon was not derived from a Hebrew text, but was derived from the present Greek text. Ioannis Marathakis is uniquely qualified for this task being a native born Greek speaker who has studied ancient and Byzantine Greek at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, as well as Latin and Hebrew. He is also well versed in the grimoires, having written on them in other publications.</p><p></p><h2>Story-Shaped Worship: Following Patterns from the Bible and History</h2><p>What is the right way to worship? Right worship does not require a return to the identical forms found in the early church or later in Rome or after that in Westminster. What it calls for is a faithful response today to the God of our salvation in light of those biblically ordered and historically informed patterns. In this study Robbie Castleman uncovers the fundamental shape of worship. What she finds&#x2015;outlined in Scripture, enacted in Israel, refocused in the New Testament community, guarded by the apostolic fathers, and recovered in the Reformation&#x2015;is a grand narrative of redemption offering order and meaning to all worshiping communities down to the present day.</p><p><strong>Robbie F. Castleman</strong> is associate professor of biblical studies and theology at John Brown University in Siloam Springs, Arkansas. She previously served for several years as a staff member with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship."If I had to choose just one to recommend, I would choose Castleman's book for its balance of scholarship and accessibility and its consistency in application of the underlying philosophy to issues such as musical form in worship." (Scott Aniol, Artistic Theologian, "Gospel-Shaped Worship: A Review of Recent Literature", 2 (2013))<br><br>"Evangelicals need to recover a theology of presence in their public worship today. Robbie Castleman encourages us to do exactly that by presenting here a richly textured and nuanced study of how liturgy interacts with spiritual life, all framed in the context of how the church has remembered and recited the story of Jesus as the story of Israel's God. A book of biblical wisdom and theological depth." (Timothy George, founding dean, Beeson Divinity School of Samford University, and general editor of the Reformation Commentary on Scripture)<br><br>"Robbie Castleman's <em>Story-Shaped Worship </em>skillfully places the biblical teachings on worship within the larger narrative of salvation history. It represents a valuable contribution to the resurgent evangelical interest in the theology and practice of worship. I heartily commend it to all pastors and seminarians who want to take worship to the next level of excellence." (John Jefferson Davis, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)<br><br>"In <em>Story-Shaped Worship</em> Robbie Castleman carefully explores the biblical basis for worship, not as something that pleases us, the worshipper, but as something meant to be pleasing to God. She then puts this in historical and practical contexts in a way that is both winsome and wise. This book is a wonderful, carefully written guide that will be helpful for worship leaders, pastors or anyone who cares about worshiping well. I'm already looking forward to working through the excellent discussion questions at the end of each chapter with other worship leaders in my church. What a great resource!" (Robert J. Keeley, professor of education, Calvin College, and author of Helping Our Children Grow in Faith)<br><br>"Robbie Castleman has written a book that brings sanity to the worship wars. The sweep of her engagement with biblical and theological material is very impressive, and her conclusions are rightly challenging to all sides. The clarity of writing and the straightforward treatment make this a book that is accessible to anyone who wants to worship in ways that please God. This book deserves to be on ministers' must-read lists, on adult Sunday school curriculum and well thumbed by congregational worship committees." (Andrew Purves, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Castleman's careful study of the biblical and historical patterns of worship should put to rest any doubt about the nature of Christian worship. Worship is not about meeting the needs of individuals but the reenactment of and participation in the grand story of the triune God. I strongly urge pastors and worship leaders to read this book before they attempt to revise their Sunday service." (Simon Chan, Trinity Theological College, Singapore)<br><br>"Though we feel drawn by the Spirit into holy space to see and worship God, what we call worship too often reflects merely our own needs and desires. Yet how we worship God must be linked with why we worship him, the central Storyteller of all creation. A wise and deep researcher, Robbie Castleman showcases how story-shaped liturgical patterns form the seasons of the Christian year." (Luci Shaw, writer-in-residence, Regent College)<br><br>"A passionate and heartfelt book, which urges that we recover a much-needed stress in worship on the narrative of salvation at the heart of the gospel. In the midst of numerous 'worship wars' we badly need books that reorient us to what really matters." (Jeremy Begbie, Duke University)<br><br>"Castleman clearly joins her voice to those of others who are pointing toward the need for biblical and confessional renewal in worship settings where contemporary evangelical influence pervades. All those with a passion for biblical teaching and liturgical formation will find much on offer in her work." (Andrew M. McCoy, Christian Scholar's Review, Summer 2014)</p><h2>Two Little Trains</h2><p><p>From two-time Caldecott Medal-winning artists Leo and Diane Dillon and beloved children&#x2019;s book author Margaret Wise Brown comes <em>Two Little Trains</em>.</p><p>With simple, bouncy text and soft, beautiful illustrations, this story is perfect for fans of things that go!</p><p>&#x201c;Sure to delight.&#x201d; (<em>Kirkus</em>, starred review)</p><p><em>Two little trains went down the track, </em><em>Two little trains went West. </em><em>Puff, Puff, Puff and Chug, Chug, Chug, </em><em>Two little trains to the west.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Two-time Caldecott Medalists Leo and Diane Dillon (<i>Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears</i> and <i>Ashanti to Zulu: African Traditions</i>) have joined their ingenious artwork with the magic of Margaret Wise Brown's words.

Now a new generation of the youngest readers will be filled with wonder at this timeless story with its splendid new illustrations. <p> Two trains are heading west. One is streamlined, the other small and old. On their parallel journeys, the trains encounter rivers, hills, snow, and dust storms, but neither is thwarted. But look closer and see that these two trains, though similar in many ways, have a surprising difference: one is the real thing, traversing the countryside, and the other is a toy, making its way across rug fringe "tracks," along the edge of a bathtub, through a tunnel made from a book, and past a broom and dust pan. Brown's brilliant yet simple text and the Dillons' clever and striking pictures, will serve as inspiration to many flights of fancy in young readers' minds. Truly exquisite.

The series first appeared in French in Le Petit Vingtieme, a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtieme Siecle on 10 January 1929. Set in a painstakingly researched world closely mirroring our own, Herge's Tintin series continues to be a favorite of readers and critics alike 80 years later.<br>The hero of the series is Tintin, a young Belgian reporter. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful fox terrier dog Snowy (Milou in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy Captain Haddock, the bright but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (Professeur Tournesol) and other colorful supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (Dupond et Dupont). Herge himself features in several of the comics as a background character; as do his assistants in some instances.<br>The success of the series saw the serialized strips collected into a series of albums (24 in all), spun into a successful magazine and adapted for film and theatre. The series is one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, with translations published in over 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date. <br>The comic strip series has long been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Herge's signature ligne claire style. Engaging, well-researched plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories within the Tintin series always feature slapstick humor, accompanied in later albums by sophisticated satire, and political and cultural commentary.</p><p>Herge, one of the most famous Belgians in the world, was a comics writer and artist. The internationally successful Adventures of Tintin are his most well-known and beloved works. They have been translated into 38 different languages and have inspired such legends as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. He wrote and illustrated for The Adventures of Tintin until his death in 1983.</p><h2>Charles H. Traub: Lunchtime</h2><p>Between 1977 and 1980, photographer Charles H. Traub (born 1945) ventured onto the streets of Chicago, New York and various European cities to take photographs of their inhabitants--male and female, young and old-at lunchtime. Colorful and direct, animated and intimate, the portraits are shot close to the subjects, composed seemingly off-the-cuff, focusing on just their heads and shoulders. Each subject reveals something of himself or herself to the camera: the woman who takes the opportunity to pose in dignified profile or the one who purses her lips in an exaggerated pout, even the somewhat less fortunate subjects caught adjusting their glasses or blinking. <br><i>Charles H. Traub: Lunchtime</i> is the first comprehensive publication of these striking color images, which were exhibited in the early 1980s in Chicago, New York and Milan. This volume maintains the cheerfulness and joy of the series, with lively pairings of photographs encouraging viewers to associate one individual with another in a new narrative of the street.</p><p>Charles H. Traub is an artist who has been photographing in the &#34;real world witness&#34; for nearly fifty years. He is the founding Chairman of the Graduate Photography, Video, and Related media at the School of Visual Arts in New York. His latest book, Dolce Via, was published by Damiani in 2013. His forthcoming interactive E-book, No Perfect Heroes: Photographing Grant is due this Spring.[Traub's portraits] present lunchtime characters like species of butterfly in an entomologist&#x2019;s shadow box...their personalities fixed to the page in extravagant, often merciless, detail.

Ever since, they have been an important part of Protestant church life. Major changes have occurred in our time as most traditions have revised their sacramental rites and experienced many changes in sacramental practices. This book traces the most significant practices in the past five centuries, explains how they often led to controversies, and examines the faith that was expressed and experienced in the sacraments. James F. White attempts to depict the whole sweep of Protestant sacramental life, so that an overall picture is possible. And he outlines the possibilities for future developments.</p><p>James F. White holds the Bard Thompson Chair of Liturgical Studies at Drew University. He previously taught at the Perkins School of Theology for twenty-two years and was professor of liturgy at the University of Notre Dame until 1999.

They soar across the sky like a live impressionist painting in brilliant swirling arcs of tangerine and gold. Their strange cries sound like pebbles tossed against a window, and they move in perfect unison, blocking out the sun.<br> <br>Amateur coders in Nevada rebuilt the long-extinct pigeon&#x2019;s DNA, then spliced it into something new and bold. Razor-tipped beaks. Metabolic hijacks. Color-shifting feathers to signal danger to the flock with a single muscle twitch.<br> <br>Through years of work, they crafted the pigeons to be stronger than their ancestors. They&#x2019;re leaner, smarter, fiercer.<br> <br>And they made them look like fire.<br> <br>I lean out over the cabin&#x2019;s porch railing, my hips pressed into the wood, squinting through the scope of my father&#x2019;s rifle. Without magnification, the flock is just a blur of stippled color, but through the scope, with my ocular tech sharpening my vision, the colors resolve into the wings and chests of individual birds.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, little birdy,&#x201d; I breathe, squeezing the trigger. The shot echoes off the mountains, and the scent of gunpowder fills the air. That&#x2019;s homemade powder. Low sulfur, fine grade, nanoprinted in the basement, rigged to fire a tranquilizer dart and bring me down a bird without killing it.<br> <br>The dart whistles through the air, a mere blur even with my tech. My audio filters peg it at Mach 2, which is far too high. My calculations were wrong again. I look away too late and see the dart hit a pigeon, blowing it into a puff of colored feathers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dammit,&#x201d; I snap, dropping the rifle, not bothering to flick on the safety. It&#x2019;s now a thirty-pound paperweight, since I&#x2019;m officially out of ammo. Well, not if you count the bullet swinging from the chain around my neck. But that&#x2019;s my insurance bullet, and it only comes off as a last resort.<br> <br>The dead bird drops like a stone, tumbling down to land on the rocky shore of the cabin&#x2019;s tiny private lake. The flock shifts direction instantly, letting out a deafening warning cry that echoes off the steep mountain slopes like a hail of gunfire.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, I know,&#x201d; I mutter. The flock scatters angrily, their plumage twitching to crimson, telegraphing the attack. I didn&#x2019;t want to hurt it. The bird was supposed to be a present. A little genehacked pet for my neighbor, Agnes, to keep her company. Now I&#x2019;ll have to bury it, because I sure as hell won&#x2019;t eat it. Barely anyone eats meat anymore, not since the outbreak.<br> <br>The last two years have taught us what we could not forget: that animals taste a lot like people.<br> <br>The porch&#x2019;s wooden railing squeaks as I launch myself over it and jog through the yard to the circle of feathers near the lake. A breeze dances through the knee-high grass, sweeping in across the water, carrying the cries of the pigeons, the chill of the evening, and the rich, deep scent of the forest.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s wild out here. This secluded valley nestled deep in the Black Hills has been my home for the last three years and my sanctuary from the outbreak. Steep, forested mountains rise on either side of the lake, and my ramshackle log cabin sits just a short walk back from the shore. It&#x2019;s so well-hidden that you almost have to know where it is to find it, but it&#x2019;s close enough to town that I can ride in on my bike. All things considered, it&#x2019;s a perfect place to spend the apocalypse, with only one down side: The comm reception sucks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Bobcat. This . . . Agnes . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I tilt my head as Agnes&#x2019;s elderly voice crackles in my ears, blasting through my subdermal comm-link. She checks up on me nearly every day but refuses to text me. Always calls, even though I can&#x2019;t hear her. I close my eyes, drawing up the mental interface to send a text, but her voice breaks through in a burst of static.<br> <br>&#x201c;Urgent . . . danger . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Her voice cuts out. No static, nothing.<br> <br>I spin around, bolting straight up the side of the mountain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Agnes?&#x201d; I shout. Damn Russian satellites. They&#x2019;re a century old, but they&#x2019;re all we can use now that Cartaxus has taken over every other network on the planet. My comm-link can get texts in the cabin, but every time I want to take a call, I have to run half a mile uphill.<br> <br>Static fills my ears. &#x201c;. . . reading me . . . Bobcat?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hang on!&#x201d; I yell, racing up the rocky slope. The path between the trees is still wet from last night&#x2019;s rain. I skid as I race around a switchback, scrambling to keep myself upright.<br> <br>She might be hurt. She&#x2019;s all alone. The old girl is armed and tough as nails, but there are things in this world you can&#x2019;t fight. Things that have no cure.<br> <br>&#x201c;Almost there!&#x201d; I shout, forcing myself up the final stretch. I burst into the clearing at the summit and double over. &#x201c;Agnes? Are you okay? Can you hear me?&#x201d;<br> <br>A beat of satellite-lag silence hangs in my ears, and then Agnes&#x2019;s voice returns. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, Bobcat. Didn&#x2019;t mean to scare you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I drop to my knees in the grass, trying to catch my breath. &#x201c;You nearly gave me a heart attack.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry. But I guess I figured out how to make you answer your comm.&#x201d;<br> <br>I roll my eyes and push the sweat-soaked hair from my face. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s so urgent?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You up on your hill?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I am now.&#x201d;<br> <br>She chuckles, her voice popping with static. &#x201c;I just got a call from one of the locals. They spotted a jeep out near your place. Big black thing. You see anything from up there?&#x201d;<br> <br>I push myself to my feet and scan the forest. From this outlook, on a clear day, I can see for miles. The Black Hills roll out before me, tumbling granite draped with pines, dotted with the flash of lakes and a web of leaf-strewn roads. This time of day two years ago, the highway to the east would have been lit up with a steady stream of headlights from the evening commute. There would have been planes flying into Rapid and the glow of houses through the trees, but instead the hills are dark, and the highway is an empty stretch of black.<br> <br>All the houses are shuttered, and the land is dotted with craters. It always makes me sick to see it like this, but it&#x2019;s the only place I can get reception.<br> <br>&#x201c;No headlights,&#x201d; I mutter. &#x201c;They might be using infrared. You sure it was a jeep?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Brand-new, they said. Has to be Cartaxus.&#x201d;<br> <br>The hair on the back of my neck rises. I&#x2019;ve never seen a jeep out here before. Cartaxus always sends its troops out in camouflaged trucks, with whining drones for air support. I scan the forest again, straining my ocular tech until my vision starts to glitch.<br> <br>&#x201c;I tried calling you,&#x201d; Agnes says. &#x201c;A few times, the last couple of days.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been in the lab,&#x201d; I mutter, scanning the roads. &#x201c;Trying to make gunpowder.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That sounds dangerous.&#x201d;<br> <br>A half smile tugs at my lips, and my fingers twitch instinctively, running over the sensitive, newly regrown skin on my palms. &#x201c;There were some minor explosions. Nothing my healing tech couldn&#x2019;t handle.&#x201d;<br> <br>Agnes clicks her tongue. &#x201c;Bobcat. When did you last eat?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Um . . . yesterday?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you have clean clothes?&#x201d;<br> <br>I glance down at my filthy sweater, my dirt-encrusted jeans. &#x201c;Uhh . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Get yourself over here right now, young lady. I don&#x2019;t like the sound of this jeep, and you need to get out of that godforsaken lab for a night. Right now, you hear me?&#x201d;<br> <br>I bite back a laugh. &#x201c;Okay, Yaya. I&#x2019;ll be there soon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Damn straight you will. And bring your dirty clothes with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The connection clicks off in my ears with a hiss, leaving me grinning. Agnes isn&#x2019;t really my yaya, though she certainly acts like it. We don&#x2019;t share DNA, but we&#x2019;ve shared food and tears, and ever since the outbreak, that&#x2019;s all that really counts. Sometimes I think the only reason either of us is still alive is that we can&#x2019;t bear the thought of leaving the other alone.<br> <br>I stretch my arms over my head, scanning the forest one last time before dialing my ocular tech back down. The embedded panel in my forearm that powers my tech chews through a few hundred calories a day even on standby, and food isn&#x2019;t exactly plentiful anymore. My vision blurs as my eyes refocus, and it takes me a second to realize there&#x2019;s a plume on the horizon that wasn&#x2019;t there before.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh-oh.&#x201d;<br> <br>I freeze, counting the seconds until the crack hits my ears. The plume rises before spreading, mushrooming out across the sky. The flock of pigeons fragments into wild, panicked streams, racing away from the billowing cloud. The sound takes fifteen seconds to hit me, which tells me it&#x2019;s three miles away. Too far to make out the details, but I can tell the cloud is a sickly shade of pink.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s the color of a human body when its cells are ripped open, blown into mist, and spat into the air.<br> <br>A Hydra cloud.<br> <br>My stomach lurches. Depending on which way the wind is blowing, this distant cloud just might kill me. One breath is all it takes. One lungful of swirling, airborne virus particles that will swarm through every cell in your body. You&#x2019;ll get a fever; you&#x2019;ll incubate; then two weeks later you&#x2019;ll go off like a grenade, infecting everyone in a mile-wide radius.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no cure, no treatment. There&#x2019;s one way to get immunity, but it&#x2019;s been twenty-six days since I last took a dose.<br> <br>Agnes&#x2019;s voice crackles in my ears. &#x201c;That . . . near you?&#x201d;<br> <br>I close my eyes, using a mental command to switch my comm over to text mode. It&#x2019;s slower&#x2014;I have to focus harder, bringing up each word separately in my mind&#x2014;but it doesn&#x2019;t need a clear signal.<br> <br>3 miles, I send. Blowing further east. Probably out of infection radius.<br> <br>haul out quick, she replies.<br> <br>I will. She doesn&#x2019;t need to tell me twice.<br> <br>I pause as I turn back to the trail, watching the cloud drift. It&#x2019;s twice as big as the clouds I first saw in the outbreak, two years ago. The virus is evolving, and the blasts are getting stronger. If they keep growing, pretty soon there won&#x2019;t be anywhere left to hide.<br> <br>I push the thought away, jogging back down the mountain, trying to dodge the worst of the mud. There&#x2019;s no need to panic about a cloud as far away as this, but without immunity, I can&#x2019;t help but feel a little nervous.<br> <br>I glance back as I descend into the trees, telling myself that it&#x2019;s miles away, that I&#x2019;ll be fine. I&#x2019;ll go to Agnes&#x2019;s place, and she&#x2019;ll feed me lentils and her disgusting licorice candies like she always does. We&#x2019;ll fire up her woodstove and play a game of cards. Simple. Easy. But just as the cabin comes into view, another crack tears through the air, and I jerk to a stop.<br> <br>A second plume shoots up, pink and leaf strewn and terrifying. Close enough that I forget to count the seconds that pass until I hear it. The mist billows into the air like a living, heaving thing, unfurling through the forest, sending the pigeons scattering. The wind is dragging it away from me, but the wind can change in a heartbeat.<br> <br>This cloud is far too close. I&#x2019;m going to have to run.<br> <br>Agnes&#x2019;s name pops up in my vision as I race down the mountain.<br> <br>another one<br> <br>I KNOW, I reply, skidding to the bottom of the hill.<br> <br>dont like this bobcat, she says. shdnt let ur immunity lapse.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s nothing I can say to that because I know she&#x2019;s right; it was reckless to let myself run out of doses. There was a reason, but thinking about it now makes my cheeks burn with its sheer stupidity.<br> <br>I bolt up the cabin&#x2019;s stairs to the porch and grab my rucksack and knife, picking up the rifle before throwing it back down. Dead weight. I race out to my bike, an old BMX with a rusted frame that can handle dirt trails like nobody&#x2019;s business. I sling my rucksack over my shoulder, slip my knife into my belt, and haul the bike out from the bushes I keep it hidden in. One leg is over it, my grip tight on the handlebars, when an alert from my audio tech sends me flying into a crouch.<br> <br>Rustling. Nearby. An unenhanced ear wouldn&#x2019;t hear it, but my filters sharpen the sound into slow, heavy footsteps. Labored and staggering. The way people move when they&#x2019;re infected.<br> <br>They&#x2019;re just beyond me, in the trees, and they&#x2019;re coming my way.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh shit,&#x201d; I breathe, my hands shaking.<br> <br>near me, I send to Agnes, my mind spinning so fast that I can barely form the words.<br> <br>HIDE NOW, she replies.<br> <br>The command is so unlike her, so frantic and bizarre that I don&#x2019;t even pause to question it. I just drop my bike and run.<br> <br>The cabin is too far, but there&#x2019;s a willow near the lake, and I haul myself up through the branches, my newly healed palms scraping against the bark. I kick and claw my way to a high branch in a matter of seconds, flying up the tree on sheer adrenaline. As soon as I find my balance, a man crashes through the bushes, and I hold my nose at the exact moment he splashes into the lake.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a blower, no doubt about it. He falls to his knees in the shallows, sucking in a wet, labored breath. He&#x2019;s badly wounded. Scarlet rivers run down his arms, trickling from innumerable gashes and bite marks covering his skin. It looks like a mob got him. I can see his teeth through the stringy hole in one cheek, and his eyes are swollen shut, his ears reduced to stumps of cartilage.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s bleeding out and feverish. Definitely infected. Second stage, probably a day away from detonating. Even with my fingers clamped over my nose, I can still feel my body starting to shake in response to his scent.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s nothing quite like the scent of infection. No odor or perfume matches the sharp, sulfurous clouds that roll off a Hydra victim&#x2019;s skin. Some people liken it to the scent of burning plastic or the air after a lightning strike. I&#x2019;ve always thought it smelled like the hot springs I visited as a child. Whatever the comparison, nobody gets much time to think about it, because as soon as the scent hits you, it takes your breath away.<br> <br>And that&#x2019;s not all it does.<br> <br>I grit my teeth, fighting the response building inside me. My fingers curl instinctively, clawing into the bark of the tree. Breathing the scent won&#x2019;t hurt me&#x2014;blowers aren&#x2019;t infectious until they detonate&#x2014;but the scent will crawl into my mind, igniting a response that&#x2019;s impossible to control. Even forcing myself to breathe through my mouth, I can still feel it whispering, rising inside me like a curse. It wants me to grab the knife sheathed at my thigh, to drop from my perch in the tree.<br> <br>To unleash the monster that wakes in me at the merest whiff of infection.<br> <br>But I don&#x2019;t want to yield to it. I tighten my grip on the tree, shake my head, and invoke my comm-link. In . . . tree . . . above him, I send to Agnes.<br> <br>The man tries to get up, but he&#x2019;s too weak. He falls to his knees, letting out a moan. The wind lifts his scent into the branches, and it hits me like a punch.<br> <br>u must do it, Agnes replies.<br> <br>I blink the words away. My chest is shuddering, my vision starting to blur.<br> <br>no choice bobcat. its the only way<br> <br>I won&#x2019;t, I write, then delete it, because she&#x2019;s right. Or maybe it&#x2019;s because the scent has me by the throat, shattering my self-control. Either way, there&#x2019;s a cloud less than a mile from me, and there&#x2019;s only one way to guarantee that I&#x2019;ll make it out of this alive. I need immunity, or I&#x2019;ll die. The math is simple.

The poems in Lerner&#x2019;s third collection are full of layered collisions&#x2014;repetitions, fragmentations, stutters, re-combinations&#x2014;that track how language threatens to break up or change course under the emotional pressures of the utterance. And then there&#x2019;s the larger collision of love, and while Lerner questions whether love poems are even possible, he composes a gorgeous, symphonic, and complicated one.</p><p><i>You startled me. I thought you were sleeping<br>In the traditional sense. I like looking<br>At anything under glass, especially<br>Glass. </i>You<i> called </i>me<i>. Like overheard<br>Dreams.

He holds degrees from Brown Univeristy, co-founded No: a journal of the arts, and teaches at the University of Pittsburgh.Starred Review. Lerner is both a favorite among young avant-garde poets and a recipient of more traditional honors&#x2014;his previous book was a finalist for the National Book Award. In his third collection, which is composed of two alternating sequences, he continues and deepens his exploration of how contemporary mass culture taints language, testing the border where words transition from expressing real feeling to being so overused they mean almost nothing. The nine-line stanzas of Mean Free Path utilize collage, found language, humor, and snippets of what seem like autobiography to question how much a poem can really say. I'm sorry, sorrier/ Than I can say on such a tiny phone. Stunningly prescient insights (In total war, the front is continuous) alternate with humorous asides and haunting admissions of the limits of interpersonal connection, noting the sudden suspicion the teeth/ In your mouth are not your own, let/ Alone the words. The page-long Doppler Elegies utilizes many of the same techniques in an attempt to construct a fragmentary love poem to Ari. Promising sentences are cut off at the line break, only to resume in the midst of another, entirely different thought, often creating pertinent juxtapositions, as in a poem that laments The life we've chosen/ from a drop-down menu. Lerner keeps refining his techniques and remains a younger poet whose work deserves attention. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I'm sure there are other words for it, but the term 'weird' sticks out prominently in my mind. So too do the words 'wacky,' 'hypnotic,' 'awe-inspiring,' and 'potentially hazardous to your health.' I do not kid. I kid a tiny bit. But the fact of the matter is that if you or a child or you AND a child ever wanted to be a part of a real world treasure hunt, the time is now. For my part, all that I care is that there&#x2019;s a new book out there with teeny tiny pictures for me to stare glazed-eye at for long periods of time. To stare and stare and stare.... what I really came to like and respect about <i>The Clock Without a Face</i> is that it has no difficulty defining its own audience. The writing and the pictures are hugely kid-friendly. Maybe a child wouldn&#x2019;t have the wherewithal to solve the puzzles, but there&#x2019;s always a chance. And where there&#x2019;s a chance there will be kid fans. I know I&#x2019;ll be handing my copy to the kids in the bookclub I run with the hope that they find a way to solve it themselves.

But he went where the Commonwealth told him to go, even if it meant going deep into enemy territory to a moon where even the nice parts didn&#x2019;t get far above freezing for much of the year.<br> Still, humanity &#x2013; or the Illyrican portion of it, at least &#x2013; had decided this rock was worth colonizing. Mineral deposits were one reason, but when it came right down to it, Kovalic was pretty sure that they&#x2019;d done it just because they <i>could</i>. Even in their pre-Imperial days, the Illyricans had felt they&#x2019;d had something to prove, and what better way to do so than to tame a wild planetoid to their whims. It didn&#x2019;t really matter that it was a barren, snowy rock; it had a breathable atmosphere and temperatures that were within the habitable range &#x2013; if only barely.<br> Through the thick, insulated windows Kovalic could see the snow hurling down outside. Blizzards were all too common on Sevastapol, and they were brutal and unforgiving; there were more deaths from exposure than almost anything else. Weather-related accidents were a close second.<br> Inside, however, it was perfectly comfortable; tapped geothermal pockets provided efficient heating for much of the populace. Kovalic had unwound his scarf and unzipped the parka he was wearing, stowing his balaclava and gloves in one of the coat&#x2019;s voluminous pockets. He raised his arm, the motion splashing a colorful display across the fabric, including the local time. Orbiting a gas giant gave Sevastapol an irregular day/night pattern; they were in false night, the sun itself down, but the light never quite gone from the sky as it reflected off the huge mottled planet that dominated the sky.<br> &#x201c;&#x2019;Scuse me,&#x201d; said a gruff voice, as a compact figure brushed past him.<br> &#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; said Kovalic.<br> The shorter man continued on, browsing along a shelf of antiquated books, most with faded printed covers, others covered in moldering leather. He didn&#x2019;t seem to be reading them, though &#x2013; mostly just staring glumly at the shelves.<br> &#x201c;Anything?&#x201d; murmured Kovalic.<br> &#x201c;Not a thing, boss,&#x201d; said Tapper. &#x201c;Quiet as my Aunt Mary&#x2019;s funeral.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t that the aunt who wasn&#x2019;t actually dead?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, but she didn&#x2019;t want anybody knowing.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Right. Well, stay sharp. It&#x2019;s almost showtime.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I was born sharp.&#x201d;<br> Kovalic coughed to cover his smile. The general consensus was that Tapper was in his sixties now, but nobody was sure exactly how old he was &#x2013; even Kovalic, and they went back twenty years. But, despite the hair that had long gone steel gray and a face like a worn leather boot, Kovalic would have put him up against any operative half his age.<br> &#x201c;Any of these good?&#x201d; Tapper asked, nodding at the books.<br> &#x201c;From a reading perspective or a collector&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br> Tapper shrugged. &#x201c;Your pick.&#x201d;<br> Kovalic scanned the titles. &#x201c;Definitely some classics among them, but I don&#x2019;t collect them. Ask Page.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get it,&#x201d; said Tapper, shaking his head. &#x201c;These things just take up space. You can download any text you want. Why would you want to clutter up your home with these musty old things?&#x201d;<br> Kovalic ran his fingers over the spine of one of the books. There was something tangible about it, he supposed: a connection you got with a physical book, from turning its pages, that you didn&#x2019;t get reading from reading the same text on a screen. The idea that, for hundreds of years, the same volume had passed through the hands of countless others, linking all of them together in one continuous thread. Not that he had any intention of starting his own collection: they were a serious pain in the ass to move.<br> A sedate chime tinkled from the door at the front of the shop. He checked his sleeve again; it was just about time.<br> He nodded to Tapper. &#x201c;Go mingle.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Aye aye,&#x201d; said the shorter man, drifting off towards another corner of the shop.<br> Kovalic went back to perusing the shelves, taking his time before casually turning around to survey the display behind him. That gave him a chance to study the front of the shop and its occupants. Besides the shopkeeper &#x2013; a tall, thin man, with tufts of gray hair that looked like they&#x2019;d been glued on &#x2013; there were a few other men and women scanning the shelves with the hungry looks of collectors searching for a find, and a couple who were poking about in the furniture portion of the shop, wearing bright new parkas and exclaiming about each new item. Those would be the tourists.<br> Then there was the new arrival.<br> Bundled up as the figure was, about all Kovalic could tell was that it was a man &#x2013; a short, stout man with a ruddy nose protruding over a subdued plaid scarf. Rather than a parka, he wore a sleek wool overcoat; more elegant than functional in the brisk Sevastapol weather. That made him a man concerned with appearances, especially when combined with the wide-brimmed felt hat pulled down tightly on his head. As disguises went, it was amateurish at best, unnecessarily conspicuous at worst.<br> The man walked past the shopkeeper, who was too busy reading from a thin volume held at arm&#x2019;s length to notice. He made his way stiffly towards the back of the shop in a manner so painfully casual that it practically shouted LOOK AT ME, I&#x2019;M STROLLING, NOTHING TO SEE HERE.<br> Kovalic tried to avoid rubbing his forehead, and stared instead at the wall of books. He&#x2019;d known going in that their contact wasn&#x2019;t trained for this sort of thing, but the general, Kovalic&#x2019;s boss, had deemed it an acceptable risk, given the man&#x2019;s stature and the value of the information on offer. Then again, the general didn&#x2019;t have to sit here and watch the worst tradecraft this side of an espionage vid.<br> As the man got closer, Kovalic&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. Something was off. The way the man was moving was <i>wrong</i>; his steps were wavering, unsure. Like he&#x2019;d been injured. As if on cue, he clutched the side of the bookcase nearest Kovalic, his gloved hand gripping the wood as if his life depended on it.<br> Hefting the book in his hand, Kovalic opened his mouth to speak his part of the sign/countersign when he was interrupted by a mumble from the man in the hat.<br> &#x201c;It was the... worst of times...&#x201d; The voice was strained, hoarse, as if each word were being dragged out of it. The man was leaning heavily against the bookshelf now. All the hair on Kovalic&#x2019;s neck stood to attention.<br> Kovalic reached over and tugged the scarf down, recognizing the face that he&#x2019;d seen in the dossier: wrinkled, pale, and jowly. But the man&#x2019;s complexion was flushed, like he&#x2019;d spent too long in the cold. Sweat beaded on his forehead, and his eyes had gone glassy. They met Kovalic&#x2019;s briefly, but there was no recognition there &#x2013; they were empty and unfocused. The man swayed briefly, then started to crumple. Kovalic stepped over quickly, easing him gently to the floor.<br> &#x201c;Shit.&#x201d; He pressed his fingers to the man&#x2019;s neck. There was a pulse, but it was thready and irregular.<br> Tapper, having seen something was off, made his way back over to his boss.<br> &#x201c;What the hell happened?&#x201d; he asked, his eyes flitting between Kovalic and the man on the floor.<br> Kovalic shook his head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Bleiden, all right, but he&#x2019;s sick or something.&#x201d; His gut clenched. He supposed that it could have just been bad luck: maybe he&#x2019;d gotten the flu that was going around. Maybe he&#x2019;d eaten some bad shellfish. Weird coincidences happened all the time.<br> Then again, Kovalic had found himself rather attached to his life over the years, and part of what had kept him alive had been sweating the small stuff. He glanced up at Tapper. &#x201c;See if this place has a first aid kit.&#x201d;<br> Tapper nodded and headed towards the front of the room. A few of the other customers were now eyeing them curiously, though none had made a move to intervene.<br> His eyes alit upon a tall, dark-haired man who was watching the scene with studied disinterest. Snapping his fingers, Kovalic got his attention. &#x201c;You. Gimme a hand.&#x201d;<br> The man looked almost surprised to be addressed, then reluctantly made his way over and crouched down by them.<br> &#x201c;How&#x2019;s your field medicine training, lieutenant?&#x201d; Kovalic murmured.<br> The man&#x2019;s expression morphed from confused to sharp so fast it was a wonder it didn&#x2019;t give Kovalic whiplash.<br> &#x201c;Rusty at best, sir,&#x201d; said Aaron Page. &#x201c;Is he wounded?&#x201d;<br> Kovalic patted the man down, checking for any obvious sign of an injury, but, as he&#x2019;d suspected, there was nothing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking poison.&#x201d;<br> Page&#x2019;s eyebrows went up at the conjecture. &#x201c;But that would mean...&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;...that he was compromised. And that they knew we were coming.&#x201d;<br> Tapper chose that moment to reappear with two things: a small dingy looking medkit that might have been new when the sergeant was young, and a troubled expression. &#x201c;Uh, boss? We got company.&#x201d; He jerked his thumb back at the windows.<br> Of course &#x2013; he should have known there&#x2019;d be another shoe.<br> &#x201c;Uniforms?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Armed response troops, with a few plainclothes running the show.&#x201d;<br> Kovalic sucked in a breath through his teeth. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be Eyes. Well, shit.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d hoped they&#x2019;d managed to fly under the radar of the Imperial Intelligence Services, but with his luck he clearly shouldn&#x2019;t be buying lottery tickets anytime soon.<br> Tapper gestured at the shop. &#x201c;Boss, this place is a kill zone. We gotta move.&#x201d;<br> Page had taken the medkit from Tapper and unzipped it, and was now rifling through the contents. &#x201c;Without knowing what they dosed him with, I&#x2019;m not sure which antidote to administer.&#x201d;<br> Kovalic rubbed his forehead. Saving Bleiden would be ideal, but at the moment, even getting themselves out of here was starting to look like a tall order. &#x201c;Lieutenant, talk to me about options, and make it quick. Sergeant, see if there&#x2019;s a back door.&#x201d; He nodded towards the rear of the shop, where a path snaked between two bookshelves. IIS wouldn&#x2019;t be dumb enough to leave an exit uncovered, but if there was any chance of getting his team out of here, Kovalic needed to know the lay of the land.<br> Tapper disappeared towards the rear of the shop while Page pulled out a vial and an injector. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s mostly bandages and ointments, but there is a dose of epinephrine that&#x2019;s only a few months past its expiration date. If whatever they gave him triggered anaphylactic shock, that might help.&#x201d;<br> Well, if it didn&#x2019;t, he&#x2019;d probably be dead anyway. Kovalic nodded to Page, who locked the vial in place and, without much in the way of ceremony, stabbed it into the man&#x2019;s thigh. There was a <i>click</i> and the man jerked.<br> Kovalic looked over at Page. &#x201c;How do we know if it wor&#x2013;&#x201d;<br> The man gasped and convulsed, his eyes springing open as he tried to sit up.<br> Grabbing him by the shoulders, Kovalic held him steady. &#x201c;Easy there.&#x201d;<br> The man&#x2019;s gaze swung wildly, seizing upon Kovalic. &#x201c;Are you... Conductor?&#x201d; he wheezed.<br> Protocol had gone out of the window by this point, so Kovalic just nodded. The man&#x2019;s hand came up and gripped Kovalic&#x2019;s arm tightly. His voice was strained again, and he fought to get each word past clenched teeth. &#x201c;Eyes... watching me.&#x201d; His grip curled Kovalic&#x2019;s parka sleeve, insistent, and the colors of the display flickered and warped. &#x201c;Important... meeting. Bayern. Three... days. Per&#x2013;&#x201d; Suddenly, his eyes rolled back into his head and he started convulsing again. White foam leaked from the edges of his mouth as his face twisted into a pained rictus. After a moment, he went limp.<br> Kovalic put a finger against his neck, but this time there wasn&#x2019;t so much as a faint pulse. Gesturing to Page, they gently laid the man down on the floor. Kovalic closed the man&#x2019;s blank eyes and let out a long breath, hand over his mouth.<br> Tapper caught Kovalic&#x2019;s eye from the back of the shop and jerked his head. There was an exit, then. He also raised five fingers and pointed them towards the rear. Five men watching it, probably waiting for the order to breach. Kovalic waved him over.<br> &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; said Tapper, glancing down at the body. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t make it?&#x201d;<br> Kovalic shook his head. &#x201c;But he gave us something &#x2013; we just need to make sure it doesn&#x2019;t go to waste.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the plan?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking we need to give the abort signal,&#x201d; said Kovalic, raising his sleeve and tapping an icon on the display. A burst of static exploded directly into his earbud, eliciting a curse.<br> &#x201c;Too late,&#x201d; he said, tapping it off. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve already set up a jamming field.&#x201d;<br> Tapper shook his head. &#x201c;Not good. Standard portable jammer has an effective radius of about twenty-five meters.&#x201d;<br> Kovalic peered at the wall behind them, measuring in his head. &#x201c;That easily covers the whole shop. And getting out of its range is going to mean fighting our way through whoever&#x2019;s out there.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;So, maybe we don&#x2019;t go through,&#x201d; said Tapper, pointing a finger at the ceiling. &#x201c;Maybe we go up?&#x201d;<br> Kovalic looked up. The shop occupied the ground floor, but the building was at least four or five stories tall. Not quite high enough to get them all the way out of the jamming field, but it didn&#x2019;t need to be &#x2013; there ought to be a comm array on the roof that they could hijack to boost the signal. He didn&#x2019;t like the idea of being trapped on the roof, but it was better than walking out of here and into the Illyricans&#x2019; hands. He glanced at his sleeve; it had been five minutes since Bleiden had come in, and Eyes surely had the place surrounded by this point. They had to move now.<br> &#x201c;Did you find a set of stairs back there?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not quite. But I think I&#x2019;ve got something.&#x201d;<br> Kovalic turned to Page. &#x201c;Keep an eye on the situation here. Let me know if it looks like they&#x2019;re about to breach.&#x201d; The lieutenant acknowledged with a tip of his head. Kovalic followed Tapper to the rear of the shop, which turned out to be a small storeroom with a side door that looked like it hadn&#x2019;t been used since the founding of the Illyrican Empire.<br> &#x201c;Jesus, would it kill them to send in a building inspection team every once in a while?&#x201d; said Tapper, kicking at a soggy cardboard box filled with decaying books. Slivers of paper launched into the air, fluttering to the ground like dying moths.<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to come back and enforce the fire code some other time. Talk to me about this exit.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; said Tapper. &#x201c;That door lets into a side alley, which feeds into the street out front, but there&#x2019;s also roof access via a fire escape &#x2013; I caught it on my recce earlier. They&#x2019;re using standard breach tactics, stacking up right here.&#x201d; He nodded to the wall to the left of the door. A workbench sat against the brickwork there; they each took an end and managed to shift it away from the wall, disturbing a cloud of what was undoubtedly valuable antique dust.<br> Wiping his hands, Kovalic rifled through his pockets, but they were empty aside from his backup comm unit.

Geronimo descendant Harlyn Geronimo explained, &#x201c;Obviously to equate Geronimo with Osama bin Laden is an unpardonable slander of Native America and its most famous leader.&#x201d; <i>The Militarization of Indian Country </i>illuminates the historical context of these negative stereotypes, the long political and economic relationship between the military and Native America, and the environmental and social consequences. This book addresses the impact that the U.S. military has had on Native peoples, lands, and cultures. From the use of Native names to the outright poisoning of Native peoples for testing, the U.S. military&#x2019;s exploitation of Indian country is unparalleled and ongoing.</p></p><p><p> Winona LaDuke is an internationally renowned activist working on issues of sustainable development, renewable energy, and food systems.

He has won numerous awards for his drawings, and his illustrations have been featured in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and <i>The New York Times</i>. He is the author and illustrator of <i>John Brown: His Fight for Freedom</i>, which was named a Best Book of the Year by <i>Publisher's Weekly</i>, and the illustrator of <i>Abe Lincoln Crosses a Creek: A Tall, Thin Tale</i>, an ALA Notable Book.This ambitious rhyming look at America's commander in chief is, like the presidencies themselves, a mixture of hits and misses. Singer's (Follow Follow) attempt both to be breezy and to give a sense of historical sweep can lead to a few awkward moments. "The most peace-loving leaders give up their credos," begins her salute to Wilson, "when faced with attacks from German torpedoes." But she doesn't shy from potentially touchy issues (Reagan's place in history, the Clinton "scandals, the trial, the chagrin"), and she infuses the familiar with new meaning, as in her verse for Teddy Roosevelt: "He took on greedy corporations/ and foreign powers with this trick: / A president should speak quite softly/ but always carry a very large stick." Hendrix's (A Boy Called Dickens) mixed-media, editorial-style portraits are handsome, often incorporating bold typographical quotes from the presidents. He imaginatively links one leader to another (a cut-paper stock market graph portrays the economic trends that led voters from Bush 41 to Clinton, for example) so readers see history not as a series of isolated moments, but as a continuous trajectory. Ages 6 8. (Dec.) PW"<br><br>Veteran author and poet Singer turns here to the forty-three men who have held the office of POTUS, giving each a swift, often irreverent poetic treatment. Like presidents, the verses are a varied lot: John Quincy Adams has a rollicking limerick-esque entry that notes "Folks found him a bother/ (as they did his father)"; Lincoln's sparer stanza addresses his fame ("By stovepipe hat, beard, large size, / he's the one we recognize"); Nixon's entry is one of Singer's self-designed "reverso" poems, appropriate for setting his achievements against his ignominy. The poems often have the compactness of epitaphs but a more interesting complexity of meter and wordplay that makes them sophisticated choices for recitation or reading aloud; the literary portraits occasionally skip some key things (McKinley's, for instance, doesn't mention his assassination) but are more often surprisingly thorough in a few short lines. Hendrix's visuals bring it all to life, with full-bleed mixed-media illustrations that combine the caricatured yet careful linework of political cartooning with crisply layered collagework. Quotes from the presidents become three-dimensional and intertwine with their scenes, while well-chosen details and clever approaches (Harrison and Cleveland play musical chairs, McKinley crouches in the shadow of Teddy Roosevelt) add perspective as well as amusement. This could be a springboard for performance, a way to spice up American History, or a Common Core friendly entr e into discussion about the merits of unorthodox presentation of fact. End matter includes a longer description of the office, a collection of presidential biographies, and a list of relevant books and websites. DS BCCB"<br><br>This attractive collection of pithy, illustrated verse takes a new look at the 43 American presidents. Each man is represented in a poem, but some share the spotlight with others. Speech balloons from the mouths of Taylor, Fillmore, Pierce, and Buchanan are spaced on the page to create one poem, while a more typical entry profiles one president per page, and Washington garners a double-page spread of his own. The appended historical notes represent each president with a tiny portrait, a quote, and an information-packed paragraph commenting on the man and his term in office. Sometimes combining drawn and painted elements with quotes, the artwork is eclectic and expressive. Packed with facts and historical references as well as human interest elements, the rhythmic, rhyming verse may sometimes baffle elementary-school children and even older students without a solid grounding in history and politics. Creative high-school teachers could find ways to use some selections in their classrooms. In fact, almost anyone reading the book will learn something new and find some amusement along the way. - Carolyn Phelan Booklist"<br><br>Witty poetry and equally clever caricatures of all 43 presidents create a book that can add spice to serious studies, but it's not for beginners. If the information in the appendix were interspersed with the poems, the less-intelligible ones-such as the four-part conversation among Taylor, Fillmore, Pierce and Buchanan-would begin to make sense. Even so, the backmatter is too spare. For example, only readers who already know such tidbits as the quotation "We have nothing to fear but fear itself" and the slogan "We like Ike" will be able to appreciate lines dedicated to those references. Singer shows mastery of poetic forms, from appropriately "tricky" word wizardry for Nixon to eminently pleasing couplets: " We will return, ' said Cleveland's spouse / the day they left their stately house. / She was right-the chief executive / had four more years (though nonconsecutive)." Some of these work well for reading aloud as a team; the Reagan page offers an excellent opportunity for a choral trio to demonstrate differing opinions about a president. Colorful artwork recalls political cartoons of yore, grounding poems in their respective eras, and highlights presidential quotations. Carefully crafted poetry and artwork ideally suited to history buffs. (author's note, presidential biographies, sources) (Informational picture book/poetry. 9-13) Kirkus"<br><br>Gr 4 Up In this impressive collection of poems and matching illustrations, Singer and Hendrix introduce readers to the chronological roster of U.S. presidents, from Washington through Obama. With just a few well-chosen lines, Singer limns the character and/or significance of each man, highlighting Washington's honesty; peace-loving Woodrow Wilson, and feisty Truman: "No one was brasher/than that former haberdasher." In her inimitable verse, she brilliantly captures Nixon's flawed legacy: "Would people remember Watergate, nothing but Watergate?" Some presidents are treated singly; others are grouped together, such as former friends and political adversaries John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. Hendrix's pen-and-ink illustrations match Singer's nuanced text: undersized James Madison faces down British ships standing on a soapbox, and an oversize William Howard Taft holds a rubber ducky in his custom-made bathtub. In the exaggerated style of political cartoons, they add wit and insightful detail. End materials offer more factual information including a paragraph on each president. There are many great books about U.S. presidents, and this one follows in the footsteps of Alice Provensen's classic The Buck Stops Here (HarperCollins, 1992) and Judith St. George's So You Want to Be President (Philomel, 2000). Most libraries will want to make room for this one; it's a wonderful teaching tool for U.S. history and a delightful, readable book for a wide audience of browsers. Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA SLJ"<br><br>"Who were these men / who had what it took / to be commander in chief of all the armed forces, / to suggest what to do with our country's resources?" Forty-three presidents receive thirty-nine poems here; Grover Cleveland gets two-one for each nonconsecutive term in office. Unlike Susan Katz's The President's Stuck in the Bathtub (rev. 5/12), which focused on quirky traits, this volume touches on more sophisticated subjects such as political ideology, foreign policy, and domestic programs. In a single poem Thomas Jefferson and John Adams debate their political differences. Zachary Taylor, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, and James Buchanan engage in a four-way conversation about states' rights, while Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren examine Manifest Destiny in a two-voiced poem. (Poor old William Howard Taft, however, is still stuck in the bathtub, as his corpulence seems to override national issues.) A quote from George Washington in a bold hand-lettered font opens the book, and with the poem positioned on the facing page, readers have space to contemplate its meaning. In other cases, however, the richly colored art overwhelms the text; for example, William Henry Harrison's poem is lost in the swirling storm that surrounds him as he delivers his inaugural address (but then again, that weather also overpowered the man, causing the pneumonia that killed him). Brief biographical notes of each president give pertinent, but abbreviated, background information; sources are included. betty carter Horn Book"</p><h2>The Stalin Front: A Novel of World War II (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>1942, at the Eastern Front.

Sebald</b><b>Gert Ledig</b> (1921&#x2013;1999) was born in Leipzig and grew up in Vienna. At the age of eighteen he volunteered for the army and was wounded at the battle of Leningrad in 1942. He reworked his experiences during the war in this novel <i>Die Stalinorgel</i> (1955). Sent back home, he trained as a naval engineer and was caught in several air raids. The experience never left him and led to the writing of <i>Vergeltung</i> (Payback) (1956).

Brooks shows that Faulkner's strong attachment to his region, with its rich particularity and deep sense of community, gave him a special vantage point from which to view the modern world.Books's consideration of such novels as <i>Light in August, The Unvanquished, As I Lay Dying, </i>and <i>Intruder in the Dust </i>shows the ways in which Faulkner used Yoknapatawpha County to examine the characteristic themes of the twentieth century. Contending that a complete understanding of Faulkner's writing cannot be had without a thorough grasp of fictional detail, Brooks gives careful attention to "what happens: In the Yoknapatawpha novels. He also includes useful genealogies of Faulkner's fictional clans and a character index.</p></p><p>Recognizing that the creative and imaginative center of Faulkner&#39;s art is Yoknapatawpha County, Brooks examines the merits of each of the works set beyond these boundaries and explores how these writings complement Faulkner as an artist. He sheds light on the literary sources that influenced Faulkner&#39;s early work and the technical innovations and general themes Faulkner was to develop in the later writing.<p><b>Cleanth Brooks</b>(1906--1994) was born in Kentucky, and educated at Vanderbilt, Tulane, and Oxford where he was a Rhodes scholar. He began his teaching career at Louisiana State University in 1932.

At 31 he was considered the finest artist in Italy, perhaps the world; long before he died at almost 90 he was widely believed to be the greatest sculptor or painter who had ever lived (and, by his enemies, to be an arrogant, uncouth, swindling miser). For decade after decade, he worked near the dynamic center of events: the vortex at which European history was changing from Renaissance to Counter Reformation. Few of his works&#x2014;including the huge frescoes of the Sistine Chapel Ceiling, the marble giant <i>David</i> and the Last Judgment<i>&#x2014;</i>were small or easy to accomplish. Like a hero of classical mythology&#x2014;such as Hercules, whose statue Michelangelo carved in his youth&#x2014;he was subject to constant trials and labors.

Pictures can split, rot, be eaten by woodworm, warp, blister, crack, cup, flake, darken, blanch, discolor, become too translucent and disappear under a centuries-old varnish; and they can also suffer from the efforts of their owners to rectify these situations: they might be transferred, relined, ironed, abraded or repainted.<br><br>Anyone writing about a work of art needs to establish at the outset how much it has changed since it was first made. This act of understanding is far from easy. We need to develop a knowledge of the physical and chemical processes which have brought paintings to their current state, in the hope that we can imagine their reversal. And we have to look as much as we can, at a wide variety of paintings, so we can learn to distinguish those in a worse or better state of preservation; we have to try to understand what it is about a picture that differentiates good and bad condition. Theories of art history have been built on works which are little more than repaint and decay, and the beginner needs to be warned about the many pitfalls dug by time for the unwary. <br><br>A great deal has been written about conservation and restoration, but this is the first book to approach the issue from the viewer&#x2019;s standpoint, and to discuss changes in appearance that affect our understanding and appreciation of works of art. This book is highly illustrated so as to make its points extremely clear.

The peoples of Eastern Europe were, he said, his &#x201c;redskins,&#x201d; and for his colonial fantasy of a &#x201c;German East&#x201d; he claimed a historical precedent in the United States&#x2019;s displacement and killing of the native population. Edward B. Westermann examines the validity, and value, of this claim in <i>Hitler's Ostkrieg and the Indian Wars</i>.<br><br> The book takes an empirical approach that highlights areas of similarity and continuity, but also explores key distinctions and differences between these two national projects. The westward march of American empire and the Nazi conquest of the East offer clear parallels, not least that both cases fused a sense of national purpose with racial stereotypes that aided in the exclusion, expropriation, and killing of peoples. Westermann evaluates the philosophies of Manifest Destiny and <i>Lebensraum</i> that justified both conquests, the national and administrative policies that framed Nazi and U.S. governmental involvement in these efforts, the military strategies that supported each nation&#x2019;s political goals, and the role of massacre and atrocity in both processes. Important differences emerge: a goal of annihilation versus one of assimilation and acculturation; a planned military campaign versus a confused strategy of pacification and punishment; large-scale atrocity as routine versus massacre as exception.<br><br> Comparative history at its best, Westermann&#x2019;s assessment of these two national projects provides crucial insights into not only their rhetoric and pronouncements but also the application of policy and ideology &#x201c;on the ground.&#x201d; His sophisticated and nuanced revelations of the similarities and dissimilarities between these two cases will inform further study of genocide, as well as our understanding of the Nazi conquest of the East and the American conquest of the West.</p><p><b>Edward B.

It is designed as a primary textbook for pre-practicum and practicum courses, although it is helpful to therapists at any point in their career. Unlike most existing resources, this guide provides a means to conceptualize an entire counseling session from start to finish and then implement the concept through basic and advanced skills. Its main thrust is to show how and through what means a counseling session develops. It describes the fundamental structure of a session as consisting of four phases&#x2014;Initial, Early Exploration, Working, and Final. Several features set this text apart from other texts on counseling skills. Not least is the simplicity with which it deconstructs the difficult process of counseling, so that students and therapists can read it, follow its instructions, and feel confident in their ability to conduct counseling sessions. A key highlight is that the text gives special attention to exploring emotion, because working with emotion presents unique challenges at every phase. In addition, the text covers interventions for specific concerns, such as helping clients resolve internal conflicts. Finally, every phase and skill is reinforced with ample exercises for practice.</p><p></p><h2>Library of Luminaries: Frida Kahlo: An Illustrated Biography</h2><p>Step into the world of one of history's most celebrated artists and feminist icons: Frida Kahlo.

Drawing on years of research, Dr. Simmons demonstrates that the almost infinite complexity of the human anatomy simply could not have developed by chance. For example:</p><ul><li>the body runs on "battery power"...from the hundreds of mitochondria in each cell</li><li>the two sexes--evolutionary theory cannot explain why they exist</li><li>every cell is its own pharmacist, chemist, and metallurgist</li></ul><p>Accessible, clearly presented, and utterly fascinating, <i>What Darwin Didn't Know </i>shows the human body to be a marvelous system constructed by an infinitely wise Designer.</p></p><p>My book has to do with medical facts and how they conflict with the theory of evolution. Darwin may have made a sincere effort to explain the life around him in the nineteenth century, but he knew little, if anything, about the human cell, heredity (why a child resembles his parents), immunity, hormones, blood pressure and scores of feedback loops that tell the body when it&#39;s too hot or too cold, hungry or full, sick or well, and tired or refreshed. These examples and many, many more are discussed. They all speak very clearly for Intelligent Design, a discussion that needs to re-enter mainstream American dialogue. Although the bibliography has over 140 scientific citations and the text has been endorsed by four Ph.D&#39;s, the book was specificaly written for the non-medical reader."Geoffrey Simmons makes Darwinism's sleight of hand plain to see."

Proclus was the last great systematizer of Greek philosophy, and his work exerted a powerful influence in late antiquity, in the Arab world, and in the Renaissance. His treatise<i> On the Eternity of the World </i>formed the basis for virtually all later arguments for the eternity of the world and for the existence of God; consequently, it lies at the heart of neoplatonic philosophy and the controversy between pagans and Christians at the end of antiquity.<br><br>Proclus&#x2019;s eighteen Arguments were quoted within John Philoponus&#x2019; polemic against him, written in the sixth century; but the opening pages of the sole extant manuscript, which contained the first Argument, have been lost. In this book, Helen Lang and A.D. Macro present the seventeen Arguments preserved by Philoponus and translate them as an independent work. The first Argument, which survives in Arabic, is also included and makes this the only complete edition of <i>On the Eternity of the World</i> since antiquity.<br><br>This bilingual edition comprises the seventeen Arguments (II-XVIII) in Greek and English, along with an introduction, synopses, and detailed notes which help readers with or without Greek to understand them philosophically and historically. Two appendices complete the volume: the Arabic text of the first Argument, also with English translation and notes, and the first modern edition of an important Latin translation from the Renaissance.<br><br>In a valuable introduction, Lang and Macro examine the complex history of these Arguments. Together with its excellent annotations, and English and Greek texts en face, the publication of Proclus&#x2019;s <i>On the Eternity of the World</i>makes available an influential work by a major figure in the history of late Greek philosophy.<br><br></p><p>"This work will be indispensable for specialists in the history of Platonism and Aristotelianism in general, and Middle and Neoplatonism in particular. It will be equally indispensable for all scholars who work in Medieval Christian, Islamic, and Jewish philosophy, Italian Renaissance thought, and theories of cosmology."&#x2015;David Winston, Graduate Theological Union <br><br>"This work makes available for the first time in English the treatise of Proclus <i>on the Eternity of the World </i>(which he presents in the form of a series of distinct arguments), and provides excellent annotations showing the provenance of these arguments, and their connection with other passages in Proclus, as well as an introduction providing the background to the controversy, which is a basic issue in dispute between Hellenic philosophy and Christianity."&#x2015;John Dillon, Trinity College Dublin <br><br>"In this superb annotated translation, Helen Lang and A.D. Macro achieve clarity of meaning along with meticulous fidelity to Proclus's prose. Proclus's arguments for eternity of the cosmos influenced Islamic civilization, the medieval Latin West, and the Italian Renaissance. And Phiopontus's refutation of Proclus in his <i>De Aeternitate Mundi contra Proclum</i> became a model for the later Christian rejection of Greek thought. This is a rich harvest of late antique thought vital for understanding the hisory of philosophy and theology in the West."&#x2015;Joel L.

After graduating from N.Y.U. law school, Grace opened a legal clinic in the city for low-income immigrant clients, and quickly established a reputation as a fierce, but fair lawyer who was always on the side of the disenfranchised.<br>&nbsp;<br>Grace's motto "Justice for those of limited means" led her to strange cases all over the city, and eventually the world. From defending an innocent giant on death row to investigating an island in Arkansas with a terrible secret about slavery; from the warring halls of Congress to a crumbling medieval tower in Italy, Grace solved crimes in-between shopping at Bergdorf Goodman and being marked for death by the sinister Black Hand. She defended a young wife who shot her would-be rapist and fought the framing of a Baltimore black man at the mercy of a corrupt police department. Known for dressing only in black, Grace was appointed the first woman U.S. district attorney in history. And when a pretty 18-year-old girl named Ruth Cruger went missing on Valentine's Day in New York, Grace took the case after&nbsp; the police gave up. Grace and her partner, the hard-boiled Hungarian detective Julius J. Kron, navigated a dangerous mystery of secret boyfriends, two-faced cops,underground tunnels, rumors of white slavery, and a mysterious pale man-- in a desperate race against time to save Ruth. When she solved the crime, she was made the first female consulting detective to the NYPD.<br><br>But despite her many successes in social and criminal justice, Grace began to see chilling connections in the cases she had solved, leading to a final showdown with her most fearsome adversary of all and one of the most powerful men of the twentieth century. <br>&nbsp;<br>This is the first-ever literary biography of the singular woman the press nicknamed after fiction's greatest detective. In the narrative tradition of <i>In Cold Blood</i> and <i>The Devil in the White City</i>, her poignant story unmasks unmistakable connections between missing girls,the role of the media, and the real truth of crime stories. The great mystery of <i>Mrs. Sherlock Holmes</i> -- and its haunting twist ending -- is how could one woman with so much power disappear so completely?</p><p>BRAD RICCA is the author of&nbsp;<i>Super Boys</i>, winner of the 2014 Ohioana Book Award in Nonfiction, winner of a 2014 Cleveland Arts Prize for Emerging Artist in Literature, and a Booklist Top 10 Book on the Arts<i>. </i>He is also the author of <i>American Mastodon</i>, winner of the 2009 St. Lawrence Book Award. He is a SAGES Fellow at Case Western Reserve University and lives with his family in Cleveland.In 1917, an 18-year-old went missing in broad daylight. In 1905, a newly minted female lawyer took on a seemingly impossible case and won. Alternating between Ruth Cruger's 1917 disappearance and earlier cases, Ricca's vividly written narrative brings to life the groundbreaking work of attorney Mary Grace Quackenbos Humiston, who championed the rights of immigrants, the poor, and young girls. She often successfully made appeals to overturn wrongful convictions, saving several people from execution at the last minute. As a detective, she took on cases, such as Cruger's, that the police had abandoned, becoming the first female U.S. district attorney and, later, a special investigator with the New York Police Department. Though this is a thoroughly researched example of nonfiction, with extensive notes and bibliography, Ricca's storytelling ability easily allows readers to forget they are reading history instead of a novel. The descriptions of Humiston's work, with its tension and danger, offer a fascinating window on daily life and policing in New York in the early 20th century, and many of the causes she backed remain current social problems. VERDICT A compelling look at a forgotten and inspiring trailblazer, this absorbing narrative will appeal to fans of true crime, history, and mysteries.&#x2014;Jennifer Rothschild, Arlington Public Library, VA</p><h2>Realizing Awakened Consciousness: Interviews with Buddhist Teachers and a New Perspective on the Mind</h2><p>If, as Buddhism claims, the potential for awakening exists in all human beings, we should be able to map the phenomenon with the same science we apply to other forms of consciousness. A student of cognitive social science and a Zen practitioner for more than forty years, Richard P. Boyle brings his sophisticated perspective to bear on the development of a theoretical model for both ordinary and awakened consciousness.<br><br>Boyle conducts probing interviews with eleven prominent Western Buddhist teachers (Shinzen Young, John Tarrant, Ken McLeod, Ajahn Amaro, Martine Batchelor, Shaila Catherine, Gil Fronsdal, Stephen Batchelor, Pat Enkyo O'Hara, Bernie Glassman, and Joseph Goldstein) and one scientist (James Austin) who have experienced awakening. From the paths they traveled to enlightenment and their descriptions of the experience, he derives three fundamental properties of awakened consciousness. He then constructs an overarching model that explains how Buddhist practices help free the mind from attachments to reality and the self and make possible the three properties of awakening. Specifically, these teachers describe how they worked to control attention and quiet the mind, detach from ideas and habits, and open themselves to compassion. Boyle's account incorporates current theories of consciousness, sociological insights, and research in neuroscience to advance the study of awakened consciousness and help an even greater number of people to realize it.</p><p><p>Buddhist teachers and scientists collaborate on a scientifically-based approach to understanding enlightenment.</p>Richard P. Boyle was an associate professor of sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles, until 1972, when he left to pursue his studies in Buddhism in the mountains of northern New Mexico. Some years later, he moved to Albuquerque and worked as a senior research scientist at the University of New Mexico&#39;s Institute for Social Research. He is currently continuing the research reported in this book and extending the theoretical model.</p><h2>YOLO Juliet (OMG Shakespeare)</h2><p><b><i>Romeo and Juliet,</i> one of the greatest love stories ever told . . . in texts?! </b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Imagine: What if those star-crossed lovers Romeo and Juliet had smartphones?

The first half of the volume sets the stage for the Constitutional Convention and is especially good on the state constitutions and the Confederation period. The Convention itself is treated in an admirable fashion, but even more important is the handling of the ratification debate, a contest which was "as hard-fought as any battle of the Revolution." This is an excellent addition to the bicentennial literature, portraying the Constitution as the "product of a revolution in political thought" and as important as independence.

The life of the &#x201c;King of Collectors&#x201d; is every bit as fascinating as the mighty bones and fossils he unearthed.</p><p>Hatcher helped discover and mount much of the Carnegie Museum's world famous, 150 million-year-old skeleton of&nbsp;<em>Diplodocus</em>, a slender-necked, long-tailed, plant-eater whose skeleton has captivated our collective imaginations for more than a century. But that wasn&#x2019;t all Hatcher discovered.&nbsp; During a now legendary collecting campaign in Wyoming between 1889 and 1892, Hatcher discovered a 66 million-year-old horned dinosaur, <em>Torosaurus</em>, as well as the first scientifically significant set of skeletons from its evolutionary cousin, <em>Triceratops</em>. Refusing to restrict his talents to enormous dinosaurs, he also discovered the first significant sample of mammal teeth from our relatives that lived 66 million years ago. The teeth might have been minute, but this extraordinary discovery filled a key gap in humanity&#x2019;s own evolutionary history.</p><p>Hatcher&#x2019;s discoveries form the bases of some of the most beloved and well-known collections and institutions in the world&#x2015;Yale, The Peabody Museum, Princeton University, the Carnegie Museum, and more. Nearly one hundred and twenty-five years after Hatcher&#x2019;s monumental &#x201c;hunts&#x201d; ended, acclaimed paleontologist Lowell Dingus invites us to revisit Hatcher&#x2019;s captivating expeditions and marvel at this real-life Indiana Jones and the vital role he played in our understanding of paleontology.</p> 16 pages of color photographs</p><p><strong>Lowell Dingus, Ph.D.</strong>,&nbsp;is a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History in New York as well as at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.

He has coauthored several books, including&nbsp;<em>Walking on Eggs</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Mistaken Extinction</em>. Lowell lives in New York City.&#x201c;Palaeontologist Lowell Dingus exhaustively tracks Hatcher&#x2019;s short but storied life, from early work for luminaries such as Othniel Charles Marsh to the astounding digs in fossil hotspots from Kansas to Patagonia that studded Hatcher&#x2019;s starry scientific trajectory.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Nature</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;From a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History, an exhaustive biography of an adventurous bone hunter, a leading figure in the heroic age of American paleontology.

Braving the sexism of the scientific world, she joined the prestigious Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry and became a prominent member of the international physics community. Of Jewish origin, Meitner fled Nazi Germany for Stockholm in 1938 and later moved to Cambridge, England. Her career was shattered when she fled Germany, and her scientific reputation was damaged when Hahn took full credit&#x2015;and the 1944 Nobel Prize&#x2015;for the work they had done together on nuclear fission. Ruth Sime's absorbing book is the definitive biography of Lise Meitner, the story of a brilliant woman whose extraordinary life illustrates not only the dramatic scientific progress but also the injustice and destruction that have marked the twentieth century.</p><p>Awards won for this title include: Watson Davis and Helen Miles Davis Prize, History of Science Society 1998; Silver Medal for nonfiction, Commonwealth Club of California 1997; Finalist, PEN Center USA West 1997; Choice Outstanding Academic Book Award; Best Books List, Library Journal 1996"Deprived of the Nobel Prize she so clearly deserved for her contribution to the discovery of nuclear fission, Lise Meitner has never been given the attention she deserves in the history of twentieth-century physics.

Should we even try to? Kant thought we were stuck with purpose, and even Darwin&#x2019;s theory of natural selection, which profoundly shook the idea, was unable to kill it. Indeed, teleological explanation&#x2015;what Aristotle called understanding in terms of &#x201c;final causes&#x201d;&#x2015;seems to be making a comeback today, as both religious proponents of intelligent design and some prominent secular philosophers argue that any explanation of life without the idea of purpose is missing something essential.</p><p>In <i>On Purpose</i>, Michael Ruse explores the history of the idea of purpose in philosophical, religious, scientific, and historical thought, from ancient Greece to the present. Accessibly written and filled with literary and other examples, the book examines &#x201c;purpose&#x201d; thinking in the natural and human world. It shows how three ideas about purpose have been at the heart of Western thought for more than two thousand years. In the Platonic view, purpose results from the planning of a human or divine being; in the Aristotelian, purpose stems from a tendency or principle of order in the natural world; and in the Kantian, purpose is essentially heuristic, or something to be discovered, an idea given substance by Darwin&#x2019;s theory of evolution through natural selection.</p><p><i>On Purpose</i> traces the profound and fascinating implications of these ways of thinking about purpose. Along the way, it takes up tough questions about the purpose of life and whether it&#x2019;s possible to have meaning without purpose, revealing that purpose is still a vital and pressing issue.</p></p><p><p>"Do humans have purposes and values? Michael Ruse, after &#x2018;a lifetime's quest for understanding,' concludes &#x2018;yes.' In this book, he journeys from Plato and Aristotle, through St. Augustine and Kant, to Darwin. The exploration is scholarly and profound, as well as eminently readable. There is much to learn from <i>On Purpose</i> and much to relish while reading it."<b>--Francisco J. Ayala, University of California, Irvine</b></p><p>"There are no other books on the story of purpose in Western thinking that have such a broad, comprehensive, and historical approach. Michael Ruse probably knows this subject better than anyone else.

Immensely popular in his lifetime, Little Walter had fourteen Top 10 hits on the R&amp;B charts, and he was also the first Chicago blues musician to play at the Apollo. Ray Charles and B.B. King, great blues artists in their own right, were honored to sit in with his band. However, at the age of 37, he lay in a pauper's grave in Chicago. This book will tell the story of a man whose music, life and struggles continue to resonate to this day.</p><p><strong>Tony Glover</strong> has been a professional musician/writer since 1962. He is the author of a best-selling guide to playing the blues harmonica, in continuous print for over 4 decades. He has performed in a legendary blues trio with "Spider" John Koerner and Dave Ray off and on since the 1960s. He lives in St. Paul, MN. <strong>Ward Gaines</strong> is a graphic designer, art restorer and professional musician, and is a noted writer and researcher on the blues. He lives in Washington, DC. <strong>Scott Dirks</strong> has written for blues magazines, hosted blues radio, produced blues recordings, and performed in blues bands over the last 20 years. He lives outside of Chicago, Illinois.Blues-harp blower Tony "Little Sun" Glover and his collaborators say Little Walter Jacobs "was to harmonica blues what Charlie Parker was to jazz saxophone." Jacobs' playing, much of it in Muddy Waters' band, "set the standard" for and "creat[ed] much of the musical language" of the modern blues harp. Bedeviled by a roving eye for the ladies (one of his best-known songs, "Boom Boom, Out Go the Lights," however, seems a simple statement of misogyny) and addictions that compromised his health, Jacobs was also the epitome of the urban bluesman. "Coupling his small 10-hole Hohner Marine Band harmonica with . . . cheap microphones," he "easily overloaded public address amplifiers" in the 1940s, but then he incorporated "the distortion and harsh tones produced when pushing amplifiers beyond their intended limits." That leads the authors to liken his innovations to the groundbreaking electric guitar tactics of Jimi Hendrix in the '60s.

After being met with skepticism from the local parish, the matter was officially placed "under investigation" by the Catholic diocese. Investigative journalist Randall Sullivan wanted to know how, exactly, one might conduct the official inquiry into such an incident, so he set off to interview theologians, historians, and postulators from the Sacred Congregation of the Causes for Saints. These men, dubbed "miracle detectives" by the author, were charged by the Vatican with testing the miraculous and judging the holy.<br>Sullivan traveled from the Vatican in Rome to the tiny village of Medjugorje in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where six visionaries had been receiving apparitions of the Virgin Mary. Sullivan's quest turns personal and takes him to Scottsdale, Arizona, site of America's largest and most controversial instances of Virgin Mary sightings, culminating an eight-year investigation of predictions of apocalyptic events, false claims of revelation, and the search for a genuine theophany-that is, the ultimate interface between man and God.</p><p>Randall Sullivan is an award-winning journalist who has written for ROLLING STONE, ESQUIRE and other magazines.The priest chosen by Bishop O&#x2019;Brien to investigate the events in Scottsdale was Father Ernest Larkin, a Carmelite theologian admired for both his intelligence and his spirituality. <p>As I began the interview I admitted that, no matter how often I heard them feathered or fudged, I still tended to accept three categories of possibility: Either the visionaries were lying, or they were delusional, or they were telling the truth. "Basically, I agree with you," Larkin replied, "but I also think that delusion, which sounds pejorative, needn&#x2019;t be. People may be telling the truth when they say they see this or that, but they may be unaware that the influence of the environment&#x2014;which can be very subtle&#x2014;encourages these experiences. I find it difficult to believe that Mary is standing on the edge of human consciousness, and maybe breaking in every now and then, here or there. The Blessed Mother is in this mysterious realm of Heaven."And there&#x2019;s no interface between that realm and ours? I asked. "I don&#x2019;t think so," Larkin answered. So he didn&#x2019;t believe in any apparitions at all? I asked the priest. "I can&#x2019;t say that," he admitted. "I believe in Lourdes. I believ! e in Fatima. </p><p>And I&#x2019;m very curious about Medjugorje. Something of a profound nature has occurred in each of these places. I don&#x2019;t know to what extent these are the effect of natural causes and to what extent they are miraculous. It&#x2019;s almost impossible to know what comes from nature and what comes from grace." </p><p>We digressed into a discussion of St. John of the Cross; Larkin reminded me that Catholicism&#x2019;s most famous mystic poet had counseled the faithful to resist all supernatural experiences, even their own. "I really believe that these events send as many people away from religion as they draw near," Larkin said. "Because they seem so bizarre, so much out of the ordinary providence of God." If he went to Medjugorje, Larkin said, "I couldn&#x2019;t help asking, &#x2018;Why would the Blessed Mother appear here when the world is falling apart everywhere else, also?&#x2019;" That&#x2019;s like asking why Jesus would raise Lazarus when there are so many other dead people, I observed. Larkin laughed. "You&#x2019;re right," he said. "It&#x2019;s the same question. I have to fall back on my a priori principle that we live in a realm of faith from which there is no escape."</p></p><h2>Introducing Translation Studies: Theories and Applications</h2><p><p>This introductory textbook provides an accessible overview of the key contributions to translation theory.<br>Jeremy Munday explores each theory chapter-by-chapter and tests the different approaches by applying them to texts.

S. G. Boggs, an artist whose consuming passion is money, or perhaps more precisely, value. Boggs draws money-paper notes in standard currencies from all over the world-and tries to spend his drawings. It is a practice that regularly lands him in trouble with treasury police around the globe and provokes fundamental questions regarding the value of art and the value of money. <br><br>"Lawrence Weschler, who evidently admires [Boggs]-something not difficult to do-has written what may be the most extraordinary biography imaginable: "weird," to use a favourite Boggs word. It does something towards changing our entire outlook on money and its uses. And the reader is left with an uneasy feeling that anything in this world can be created by drawing it." &#x2014;Ruth Rendell, <i>Daily Telegraph</i><br><br>"As ideal a subject matter as money is for Boggs' genius, Boggs is as ideal a topic for Weschler's considerable talents. . . . A writer any less lucid than Weschler would smudge the lines, making of Boggs a counterculture caricature or a high-art huckster. And a writer any less confident would knock the balance, making academic mud pies of Boggs' enlightened chaos." &#x2014;Jonathon Keats, <i>San Francisco Chronicle Book Review</i><br><br>"[A] witty and engaging chronicle. . . . Weschler's fascinating account of the artist as agent provocateur demonstrates both the significance of Boggs's art and his determination to continue his unusual critique of the idea of money." &#x2014;Henry Wessells, <i>Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>"[A] witty, excellently written account of a bizarre and fascinating snippet of modern life." &#x2014;Paul Ormerod, <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i><br><br>"The book, like the artist, challenges people to pause and consider the extent to which the economic bedrock of everyday life is in part a confusing welter of artistic abstractions. It's a work that is at once informative, entertaining, and provocative-a reading experience, one might say, of rather good value." &#x2014;Toby Lester, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i><br><br>"[A] fascinating tale, especially in these days of fluctuating currency rates, the euro, and inexplicable Net-stock valuations." &#x2014;Paul Lukas, <i>Fortune</i><br><br>Lawrence Weschler, a recipient of the prestigious Lannan Literary Award for 1998, is the author of numerous books, including <i>Calamities of Exile: Three Nonfiction Novellas</i>, and <i>Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder</i>, which was a finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award.</p><p>James Stephen George Boggs is not a con artist, he's a talented artist who deftly renders his own currency and "spends" it. Struck by the value of money, and what paper notes represent, he draws U.S. dollar bills, English pound notes, Swiss francs, and other forms of paper money; then he barters his illustrious artwork in lieu of cash to willing merchants who agree to honor his currency for services and products. In <i>Boggs: A Comedy of Values</i>, Lawrence Weschler, author of the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Critics Circle Award-winning book <i>Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder</i>, documents Boggs's whimsical antics, offering a quirky and lively meditation on the value of currency and workmanship and a richly informative (albeit brief) social history of money.<p> Boggs does not sell his "money" directly, as Weschler learns, nor does he attempt to pass his drawings off as actual bills. For Boggs, the elaborate transaction of negotiation is a crucial element in his work, and the tangible proof of his success--receipts and proper change--is included in the final product. Of course, treasury departments from around the world are anything but pleased; the second half of the book deals extensively with the artist's court battle with the Bank of England. As Weschler notes, Boggs is not the first to question the value of money through art (Larry Rivers, Pablo Picasso, Timm Ulrichs, Adolf W�lfi, and Jurgen Harten are just some artists who have put currency to the test), but the author finds in Boggs's work an ideal subject for opening a probing inquiry into the economy of money, especially timely at the end of the 20th century as paper currency--which once directly represented precious-metal coins--evolves into "binary sequences of pulses racing between computers." <i>--Kera Bolonik</i></p>In this highly entertaining book, Lawrence Weschler chronicles the antics of J.

What commentators miss, however, is that increasing polarization has been closely accompanied by fundamental social and economic changes&#x2015;most notably, a parallel rise in income inequality. In this second edition of <i>Polarized America</i>, Nolan McCarty, Keith Poole, and Howard Rosenthal use the latest data to examine the relationships of polarization, wealth disparity, immigration, and other forces. They find that inequality feeds directly into political polarization, and polarization in turn creates policies that further increase inequality. </p><p>Paul Krugman called the first edition of <i>Polarized America</i> &#x201c;Important.... Essential reading for anyone who wants to understand what's happening to America.&#x201d; The second edition has been thoroughly brought up to date. All statistical analyses, tables, and figures have been updated with data that run through 2012 or 2014, and the text has been revised to reflect the latest evidence. The chapter on campaign finance has been completely rewritten (with Adam Bonica as coauthor); the analysis shows that with so much &#x201c;soft&#x201d; money coming from very wealthy ideological extremists, there is even greater campaign contribution inequality than income inequality.</p></p><p>Nolan McCarty is Susan Dod Brown Professor of Politics and Public Affairs at Princeton University.<br><br>Keith T.

Following a brief introduction on the history of photography and on contemporary issues in taking photographs, this book introduces readers to cameras and lenses, moves on to the specifics of black-and-white and color photography, and concludes with an interesting chapter on field trips. All aspects of photography are thoroughly presented in a clear, readable manner. In fact, the book is much more accessible than Adams's classic series. The title is also something of a misnomer, because experienced photographers as well as beginners will find this book to be of great value. Given the number and quality of reproductions as well as the abundance and quality of information, this book is certainly one of the best manuals available.

As a researcher and thought leader on matters organizational and strategic, Karl gets an eleven on my scale of one to ten. Now Weick and Sutcliffe have written on a subject they have been researching for a very long time: excellence in responding to crisis in organizational settings that are inherently complex and dangerous. The differences they find between these organizations and the ones that, well, kill people have much to teach us all, even those of us operating in less dangerous settings. I loved this book, even the footnotes."<br> --Bob Waterman, coauthor, In Search of Excellence<br> <br> "The cost of unpleasant surprises in business is escalating. Missed earnings or late and unsafe products or services, for example, can result in disastrous consequences for a company and its management . . . .

Weick and Sutcliffe's book is filled with recipes for success."<br> --Karlene H. Roberts, professor, Walter A. Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley</p><p>One of the great challenges any business or organization can face is how to deal with the unexpected. While traditional managerial practices such as planning are designed to manage unexpected threats, they often make things worse. How do you organize for high performance in a setting where the potential for error and disaster is overwhelming? In this book, the ninth in the University of Michigan Business School Management Series, Karl Weick and Kathleen Sutcliffe look to high reliability organizations (HROs)? aircraft carriers, nuclear power plants, fire-fighting crews, and others-for the answer. HROs have developed ways of acting that provide a template for all organizations that want to be more reliable in managing the unexpected. Managing the Unexpected shows executives and upper level managers how to manage under trying conditions. The authors reveal how HROs create a collective state of mindfulness that produces an enhanced ability to discover and correct errors before they escalate into a crisis. Through a discussion of this principle and the practices that can be used to apply it, the authors show how to anticipate and respond to threats with flexibility rather than rigidity. Their practical, solutions-oriented approach includes numerous case studies demonstrating &#34;mindful&#34; practices and enables readers to assess and implement mindfulness in their own organizations.

And it is in this exciting time and exotic place that a giant of an Englishman, Dirk Straun, sets out to turn the desolate island of Hong Kong into an impregnable fortress of British power, and to make himself supreme ruler...Tai-Pan!<br><i><br></i></p><p>James Clavell, who died in 1994, was a screenwriter, director, producer, and novelist born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Although he wrote the screenplays for a number of acclaimed films, including <i>The Fly</i> (1958), <i>The Great Escape</i> (1963), and <i>To Sir With Love</i> (1967), he is best known for his epic novels in his Asian Saga.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i><i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>"A pox on this stinking island," Brock said, staring around the beach and up at the mountains. "The whole of China at our feets and all we takes be this barren, sodding rock."<br><br>He was standing on the foreshore with two of his fellow China traders. Scattered about them were other clusters of traders, and officers from the expeditionary force. They were all waiting for the Royal Navy officer to begin the ceremony. An honor guard of twenty marines was drawn up in two neat lines beside the flagpole, the scarlet of their uniforms a sudden splash of color. Near them were the untidy knots of sailors who had just fought the flagpole into the stony soil.<br><br>"Eight bells were time to raise the flag," Brock said, his voice rasping with impatience. "It be an hour past. Wot's godrotting delay for?"<br><br>"It's bad joss to curse on a Tuesday, Mr. Brock," Jeff Cooper said. He was a lean, hook-nosed American from Boston, his frock coat black and his felt top hat set at a jaunty angle. "Very bad!"<br>Cooper's partner, Wilf Tillman, stiffened slightly, feeling the underlying edge to the younger man's nasal voice. He was thickset and ruddy, and came from Alabama.<br><br>"I'll tell thee right smartly, this whole godrotting flyspeck be bad joss!" Brock said. "Joss" was a Chinese word that meant Luck and Fate and God and the Devil combined. "Godrotting bad."<br><br>"It better not be, sir," Tillman said. "The future of the China trade's here now&#x2014;good joss or bad joss."<br><br>Brock stared down at him. "Hong Kong's got no future. It's open ports on the China mainland we be needing, and you knowed it, by God!"<br><br>"The harbor's the best in these waters," Cooper said. "Plenty of room to careen and refit all our ships. Plenty of room to build our homes and warehouses. And no Chinese interference at long last."<br><br>"A colony's got to have arable land and peasants to work the land, Mr. Cooper. An' revenue," Brock said impatiently. "I be walking all over and so have you. Not a crop'll grow here. There be no fields or streams, no grazing land. So no meat and no spuds. Everything we be needing'll have to come by sea. Think of the cost. Why, even the fishing be rotten. An' who's to pay upkeep of Hong Kong, eh? Us and our trade, by God!"<br><br>"Oh, that's the sort of colony you want, Mr. Brock?" Cooper said. "I thought the British Empire"&#x2014;he spat deftly to windward&#x2014;"had enough of that sort of colony."<br><br>Brock's hand strayed near his knife. "Be you spitting to clear yor throat, or spitting on the Empire?" Tyler Brock was nearing fifty, a big, one-eyed man as hard and as permanent as the iron he had been forced to peddle in Liverpool as a youth, and as strong and as dangerous as the fighting merchant ships he had escaped to and at length had come to rule as head of Brock and Sons. His clothes were rich and the knife at his belt was jeweled. His beard was graying like his hair.<br><br>"It's a cold day, Mr. Brock," Tillman said quickly, inwardly angry at his young partner's loose tongue. Brock was no man to bait, and they could not afford open enmity with him yet. "Plenty of chill on the wind, eh, Jeff?"<br><br>Cooper nodded briefly. But he did not take his eyes off Brock. He had no knife, but there was a derringer in his pocket. He was of a height with Brock but slighter, and unafraid.<br><br>"I be givin' thee piece of advice, Mr. Cooper," Brock said. "Best not spit too often after saying 'British Empire.' There be some wot baint be givin' thee benefit of doubt."<br><br>"Thank you, Mr. Brock, I'll remember," Cooper replied easily. "And I'll give you some advice: It's bad joss to curse on a Tuesday."<br><br>Brock suppressed his temper. Eventually he would crush Cooper and Tillman and their company, the biggest of the American traders. But now he needed them as allies against Dirk and Robb Struan. Brock cursed joss. Joss had made Struan and Company the greatest house in Asia, and so rich and powerful that the other China traders had named it in awe and jealousy The Noble House&#x2014;noble because it was first in riches, first in largess, first in trade, first in clippers, but mostly because Dirk Struan was Tai-Pan, the Tai-Pan among all the tai-pans of Asia. And joss had cost Brock an eye seventeen years ago, the year that Struan had founded his empire.<br><br>It had happened off Chushan Island. Chushan was just south of the huge port of Shanghai, near the mouth of the mighty Yangtse River. Brock had beaten up through the monsoon with a huge cargo of opium&#x2014;Dirk Struan a few days astern, also carrying opium. Brock had reached Chushan first, sold his cargo and turned around, knowing happily that now Struan would have to go farther north and try a new coast with fresh risks. Brock had sped south for home&#x2014;Macao&#x2014;his coffers filled with bullion, the full wind astern. Then a great storm had suddenly swooped out of the China seas. The Chinese called these storms tai-fung, the Supreme Winds. The traders called them typhoons. They were terror incarnate.<br><br>The typhoon had battered Brock's ship mercilessly, and he had been pinned by the falling masts and spars. A shorn halyard, caught by the winds, had flailed him as he lay helpless. His men had cut him loose but not before the broken shackle-ended rope had gouged out his left eye. The ship had been on her beam ends and he helped them cut the rigging and spars adrift, and by some miracle she had righted herself. Then he had poured brandy into the bleeding socket; he could still remember the pain.<br><br>And he recalled how he had limped into port long after he had been given up for lost, his fine three-masted clipper no more than a hulk, the seams sprung, masts and guns and rigging gone. And by the time Brock had replaced spars and rigging and masts and cannon and powder and shot and men, and bought another cargo of opium, all the profits of this voyage had vanished.<br><br>Struan had run into the same typhoon in a small lorcha&#x2014;a boat with a Chinese hull, English-rigged and used for coastal smuggling in fine weather. But Struan rode out the storm and, elegant and untouched as usual, had been on the dock to greet Brock, his strange green eyes mocking him.<br><br>Dirk and his cursed joss, Brock thought. Joss be letting Dirk build that one stinking lorcha into a fleet of clippers and hundreds of lorchas, into warehouses and bullion to spare. Into godrotting Noble House. Joss pushed Brock and Sons into godrotting second place. Second. And, he thought, joss's given him ear of our godrotting weak-gutted plenipotentiary, the Honorable Godrotting Longstaff, all these years. An' now, together, they've sold us out. "A&nbsp; pox on Hong Kong and a pox on Struan!"<br>"If it weren't for Struan's plan, you'd never have won your war so easily," Cooper said.<br><br>The war had begun at Canton two years before, when the Chinese emperor, determined to bring the Europeans to heel, tried to eliminate the opium smuggling which was essential to British trade. Viceroy Ling had surrounded the foreign settlement at Canton with troops, and demanded every case of opium in Asia to ransom the lives of the defenseless English traders. At length, twenty thousand cases of opium had been given over and destroyed, and the British were allowed to retreat to Macao. But the British could not take lightly either interference with its trade or threats to its nationals. Six months ago the British Expeditionary Force had arrived in the Orient and ostensibly had been placed under the jurisdiction of Longstaff, the Captain Superintendent of Trade.<br><br>But it was Struan who conceived the inspired plan to by-pass Canton, where all the trouble had started, and instead send the expeditionary force north to Chushan. To take that island without loss would be simple, Struan had theorized, for the Chinese were unprepared and helpless against any modern European army or fleet. Leaving a small holding force at Chushan and a few ships to blockade the Yangtse, the expeditionary force could sail north to the mouth of the Pei Ho River and threaten Peking, the capital of China, which was only a hundred miles upstream. Struan knew that only so direct a threat would make the emperor immediately sue for peace. A superb conception. And it had worked brilliantly. The expeditionary force had arrived in the Orient last June. By July Chushan had been taken. By August it was moored at the Pei Ho. In two weeks the emperor had sent an official to negotiate peace&#x2014;the first time in history that any Chinese emperor had officially acknowledged any European nation. And the war had ended with almost no loss to either side.<br><br>"Longstaff was very wise to follow the plan," Cooper said.<br><br>"Any China trader knowed how to bring the Chinee to their knees," Brock said, his voice rough. He pushed his top hat farther back on his forehead and eased his eye patch. "But why did Longstaff and Struan agree to negotiate back at Canton, eh? Any fool knowed 'negotiate' to a Chinee means to play for time. We should've stayed north at the Pei Ho till peace were signed. But no, we brung back the fleet and for the last six month we be waiting and waiting for the buggers to set pen to paper." Brock spat. "Stupid, crazy stupid. An' all that waste of time and money for this stinking rock. We should've kept Chushan. Now, there be island worth having." Chushan was twenty miles long and ten wide and its land fertile and rich&#x2014;a good port and a big city, Tinghai. "Space for a man to breathe in there, right enough. Why, from there three or four frigates can blockade the Yangtse at the drop of a topper. An' who controls that river controls the heart of China. That's where we should settle, by God."<br><br>"You still have Chushan, Mr. Brock."<br><br>"Yus. But it baint deeded in godrotting treaty, so it baint our'n." He stamped his feet against the growing chill wind.<br><br>"Perhaps you should mention it to Longstaff," Cooper said. "He's susceptible to advice."<br><br>"Not to mine, he baint. As thee rightly knowed. But I'll tell thee, when Parliament hear about the treaty, there be hell to pay, I'll be bound."<br><br>Cooper lit a cheroot. "I'm inclined to agree. It is an astonishing piece of paper, Mr. Brock. For this day and age. When every European power is land-_grabbing and power-hungry."<br><br>"And I suppose the United States baint?" Brock's face tightened. "Wot about yor Indians? The Louisiana Purchase? Spanish Florida? You be havin' eyes on Mexico and Russian Alaska. The last mails told you be even trying to steal Canada. Eh?"<br><br>"Canada's American, not English. We're not going to war over Canada&#x2014;she'll join us of her own free will," Cooper said, hiding his worry. He tugged at his muttonchop whiskers and pulled his frock coat tighter around his shoulders against the sharpening wind. He knew that war with the British Empire would be disastrous at this time, and would ruin Cooper-Tillman. God damn wars. Even so, he knew that the States would have to go to war over Mexico and Canada unless there was a settlement. Just as Britain had had to go to war with China.<br><br>"There won't be a war," Tillman said, trying to quiet Cooper diplomatically. He sighed and wished himself back in Alabama. A man can be a gentleman there, he thought. There you don't have to deal with the damned British every day, or with blasphemous, foulmouthed scum like Brock, or a devil incarnate like Struan&#x2014;or even with an impetuous young man and senior partner like Jefferson Cooper, who thinks Boston the center of the earth. "And this war's over, for better or worse."<br><br>"Mark my words, Mr. Tillman," Brock said. "This godrotting treaty be no good for us'n and no good for they. We've to keep Chushan and open ports on mainland China. We be at war again in a few weeks. In June when the wind be ripe and the weather be ripe, the fleet'll have to sail north to Pei Ho again. An' if we be at war again, how we going to get season's teas and silks, eh? Last year almost no trade because of war&#x2014;the year before no trade at all an' they stole all our opium to boot. Eight thousand cases from me alone. Two million taels of silver that cost me. Cash."<br><br>"That money's not lost," Tillman said. "Longstaff ordered us to give it up. To ransom our lives. He gave us paper on the British Government. And there's a settlement in the treaty. Six million taels of silver to pay for it."<br><br>Brock laughed harshly. "Thee think Parliament be honoring Longstaff's paper? Why, any Government'd be throwed out of office the moment they asked for the brass to pay for opium. An' as to the six million&#x2014;that be paying for the cost of the war. I knowed Parliament better'n you. Kiss yor half million taels goodbye be my advice to you both. So if we be at war again this year, there be no trade again. An' if we baint trading this year, we be all bankrupt. You, me, every China trader. An' even the godrotting Noble House." He jerked out his watch. The ceremony was to have started an hour ago. Time be running out, he thought. Yus, but not on Brock and Sons, by God. Dirk's had seventeen-year run of good joss, and now be time for change.<br><br>Brock reveled in the thought of his second son, Morgan, who capably&#x2014;and ruthlessly&#x2014;controlled all their interests in England. He wondered if Morgan had been successful in undermining Struan's influence in Parliament and in banking circles. We be going to wreck thee, Dirk, he thought, and Hong Kong along with thee. "Wot the hell be the delay for?" he said, hastening toward the naval officer who was striding up and down near the marines.<br><br>"What's the matter with you, Jeff? You know he's right about Hong Kong," Tillman said. "You ought to know better than to bait him."<br><br>Cooper smiled his thin smile. "Brock's so goddam sure of himself. I couldn't help it."<br><br>"If Brock's right about the half million taels, we're ruined."<br><br>"Yes. But Struan will lose ten times that if there's no payment. He'll get paid, never fear. So we'll get ours." Cooper looked after Brock. "Do you think he knows about our deal with Struan?"<br><br>Tillman shrugged. "I don't know. But Brock's right about the treaty. It's stupid. It'll cost us a pretty penny."<br><br>For the last three months Cooper-Tillman had been acting as secret agents for The Noble House. British warships had been blockading Canton and the Pearl River, and British traders were forbidden to trade. Longstaff&#x2014;at Struan's bidding&#x2014;had put the embargo on as another measure to force the peace treaty, knowing that the Canton warehouses were bulging with teas and silks. But since America had not declared war on China, American ships could go through the blockade freely and thumb their noses at the warships. So Cooper-Tillman had bought four million pounds of tea from Chen-tse Jin Arn&#x2014;or Jin-qua, as he was nicknamed&#x2014;the richest of the Chinese merchants, and shipped it to Manila, supposedly for Spanish merchants. The local Spanish official, for a considerable bribe, had issued the necessary import and export licenses, and the tea was transferred&#x2014;duty free&#x2014;into Struan's clippers and rushed to England. Payment to Jin-qua was a shipload of opium delivered secretly by Struan somewhere up the coast.</p><h2>Software Tools</h2><p>With the same style and clarity that characterized their highly acclaimed book The Elements of Programming Style the authors have written Software Tools to teach how to write good programs that make good tools The programs contained in the book are not artificial but are actual programs ae tools which have proved valuable in the production of other programs Modern programming techniques such as structured programming and top down design are emphasized and applied to every program The programs are presented in a structured language called Ratfor Rational Fortran which can be easily understood by anyone familiar with Fortran or PL I Algol PASCAL or similar languages Ratfor translates readily into Fortran or PL I One of the tools presented is a preprocessor to translate Ratfor into Fortran All of the programs are complete and have been tested directly from the text The programs are available in machine readable form from Addison Wesley Software Tools is ideal for use in a software engineering course for a second course in programming or as a supplement in any programming course All programmers professional and student will find the book invaluable as a source of proven useful programs for reading and study Numerous exercises are provided to test comprehension and to extend the concepts presented in the text</p><p><p> <b>Brian W.

This book offers an introduction to philosophy of language by explaining ten classic, often anthologized, texts. Accessible and thorough, written with a unique combination of informality and careful formulation, the book addresses sense and reference, proper names, definite descriptions, indexicals, the definition of truth, truth and meaning, and the nature of speaker meaning, as addressed by Frege, Kripke, Russell, Donnellan, Kaplan, Evans, Putnam, Tarski, Davidson, and Grice. The explanations aim to be as simple as possible without sacrificing accuracy; critical assessments are included with the exposition in order to stimulate further thought and discussion.</p><p><i>Philosophy of Language</i> will be an essential resource for undergraduates in a typical philosophy of language course or for graduate students with no background in the field.

Scottish embryologist D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860-1948) grew up in the newly cast shadow of Darwinism, and he took issue with some of the orthodoxies of the day--not because they were necessarily wrong, he said, but because they violated the spirit of Occam's razor, in which simple explanations are preferable to complex ones. In the case of such subjects as the growth of eggs, skeletons, and crystals, Thompson cited mathematical authority: these were matters of "economy and transformation," and they could be explained by laws governing surface tension and the like. (He doubtless would have enjoyed the study of fractals, which came after his time.) In <i>On Growth and Form</i>, he examines such matters as the curve of frequency or bell curve (which explains variations in height among 10-year-old schoolboys, the florets of a daisy, the distribution of darts on a cork board, the thickness of stripes along a zebra's flanks, the shape of mountain ranges and sand dunes) and spirals (which turn up everywhere in nature you look: in the curve of a seashell, the swirl of water boiling in a saucepan, the sweep of faraway nebulae, the twist of a strand of DNA, the turns of the labyrinth in which the legendary Minotaur lived out its days). The result is an astonishingly varied book that repays skimming and close reading alike. English biologist Sir Peter Medawar called Thompson's tome "beyond comparison the finest work of literature in all the annals of science that have been recorded in the English tongue." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Why do living things and physical phenomena take the forms they do?

We analyzed man&#39;s subjective experiences of the Other and found in them the basis for his understanding of the Other&#39;s subjective processes of consciousness. The very assumption of the existence of the Other, however, introduces the dimension of intersub� jectivity. The world is experienced by the Self as being inhabited by other Selves, as being a world for others and of others. As we had occasion to point out, intersubjective reality is by no means homogeneous. The social world in which man finds himself exhibits a complex structure; fellow-men appear to the Self under different aspects, to which correspond different cognitive styles by which the Self perceives and apprehends the Other&#39;s thoughts, motives, and actions. In the present investigation it will be our main task to describe the origin of the differentiated structures of social reality as well as to reveal the principles underlying its unity and coherence. It must be stressed that careful description of the processes which enable one man to understand another&#39;s thoughts and actions is a prerequisite for the methodology of the empirical social sciences.

Formal mathematics prerequisites are minimal; calculus is not required. There are no computer science prerequisites. The book includes examples, exercises, figures, tables, sections on problem-solving, section reviews, notes, chapter reviews, self-tests, and computer exercises to help the reader master introductory discrete mathematics. In addition, an Instructor's Guide and World Wide Web site are available. </p><p> The main changes in this edition (discussed in more detail later) are an expanded discussion of logic and proofs, the addition of two sections on discrete probability, a new appendix that reviews basic algebra, many new examples and exercises, section reviews, and computer exercises. OVERVIEW </p><p> In the early 1980s there were almost no books appropriate for an introductory course in discrete mathematics. At the same time, there was a need for a course that extended students' mathematical maturity and ability to deal with abstraction and also included useful topics such as combinatorics, algorithms, and graphs. The original edition of this book (1984) addressed this need. Subsequently, discrete mathematics courses were endorsed by many groups for several different audiences, including mathematics and computer science majors. A panel of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) endorsed a year-long course in discrete mathematics. The Educational Activities Board of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) recommended a freshman discrete mathematics course. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and IEEE accreditation guidelines mandated a discrete mathematics course. This edition, like its predecessors, includes topics such as algorithms, combinatorics, sets, functions, and mathematical induction endorsed by these groups. It also addresses understanding and doing proofs and, generally, expanding mathematical maturity. ABOUT THIS BOOK </p><p> This book includes</p><p>Logic (including quantifiers), proofs, proofs by resolution, and mathematical induction (Chapter 1). Sets, sequences, strings, sum and product notations, number systems, relations, and functions, including motivating examples such as an application of partial orders to task scheduling (Section 2.4), relational databases (Section 2.7), and an introduction to hash functions and pseudorandom number generators (Section 2.8). A thorough discussion of algorithms, recursive algorithms, and the analysis of algorithms (Chapter 3). In addition, an algorithmic approach is taken throughout this book. The algorithms are written in a flexible form of pseudocode. (The book does not assume any computer science prerequisites; the description of the pseudocode used is self-contained.) Among the algorithms presented are the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (Section 3.3), tiling (Section 3.4), the RSA public-key encryption algorithm (Section 3.7), generating combinations and permutations (Section 4.3), merge sort (Section 5.3), Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm (Section 6.4), backtracking algorithms (Section 7.3), breadth-first and depth-first search (Section 7.3), tree traversals (Section 7.6), evaluating a game tree (Section 7.9), finding a maximal flow in a network (Section 8.2), finding a closest pair of points (Section 11.1), and computing the convex hull (Section 11.3). A full discussion of the "big oh," omega, and theta notations for the growth of functions (Section 3.5)., Having all of these notations available makes it possible to make precise statements about the growth of functions and the complexity of algorithms. Combinations, permutations, discrete probability, and the Pigeonhole Principle (Chapter 4). Recurrence relations and their use in the analysis of algorithms (Chapter 5). Graphs, including coverage of graph models of parallel computers, the knight's tour, Hamiltonian cycles, graph isomorphisms, and planar graphs (Chapter 6). Theorem 6.4.3 gives a simple, short, elegant goof of the correctness of Dijkstra's algorithm. Trees, including binary trees, tree traversals, minimal spanning trees, decision trees, the minimum time for sorting, and tree isomorphisms (Chapter 7). Networks, the maximal flow algorithm, and matching (Chapter 8). A treatment of Boolean algebras that emphasizes the relation of Boolean algebras to combinatorial circuits (Chapter 9). An approach to automata emphasizing modeling and applications (Chapter 10). The SR flip-flop circuit is discussed in Example 10.1.11. Fractals, including the von Koch snowflake, are described by special kinds of grammars (Example 10.3.19). An introduction to computational geometry (Chapter 11). An appendix on matrices, and another that reviews basic algebra. A strong emphasis on the interplay among the various topics. As examples, mathematical induction is closely tied to recursive algorithms (Section 3.4); the Fibonacci sequence is used in the analysis of the Euclidean algorithm (Section 3.6); many exercises throughout the book require mathematical induction; we show how to characterize the components of a graph by defining an equivalence relation on the set of vertices (see the discussion following Example 6.2.13); and we count the number of n-vertex binary trees (Theorem 7.8.12). A strong emphasis on reading and doing proofs. Most proofs of theorems are illustrated with annotated figures. Ends of proofs are marked with a square symbol. Separate sections (Problem-Solving Corners) show students how to attack and solve problems and how to do proofs. Numerous worked examples throughout the book. (There are over 500 worked examples.) A large number of applications, especially applications to computer science. Over 3500 exercises, with answers to about one-third of them in the back of the book. (Exercises with numbers in color have an answer in the back of the book.) Figures and tables to illustrate concepts, to show how algorithms work, to elucidate proofs, and to motivate the material. Several figures illustrate proofs of theorems. The captions of these figures provide additional explanation and insight into the proofs. Section reviews. Notes sections with suggestions for further reading. Chapter reviews. Chapter self-tests. Computer exercises. A reference section containing 150 references. Front and back endpapers that summarize the mathematical and algorithm notation used in the book. CHANGES FROM THE FOURTH EDITION The first chapter on logic and proofs is considerably enhanced. Several new motivating examples have been added. A logic game, which offers an alternative way to determine whether a quantified propositional function is true or false, is discussed in Example 1.3.17. Section 1.4 now includes rules of inference for both propositions and quantified statements. The number of exercises in this chapter has been increased from 232 to 391. Arrow diagrams have been added to give a pictorial view of the definition of a function, one-to-one functions, onto functions, inverse functions, and the composition of functions (see Section 2.8). Graphs of functions have been added to give yet another view of functions (see Section 2.8). Two optional sections (Sections 4.4 and 4.5) have been added on discrete probability. We discuss the fundamental terminology (e.g., experiment, event), the use of counting techniques to compute probabilities, basic formulas, mutually exclusive events, conditional probability, independent events, and Bayes' Theorem and its use in pattern recognition. The setting for the Problem-Solving Corner in Chapter 5 has been changed to a more inviting and contemporary setting: sorting in a spreadsheet. The fourth edition's Section 8.5 on Petri nets has been moved to the Web site that accompanies this book. Appendix B, which reviews basic algebra, has been added. The topics treated are rules for combining and simplifying expressions, fractions, exponents, factoring, quadratic equations, inequalities, and logarithms. A number of computer examples now show actual computer screens to help connect the theory to practical applications. Several new examples have been added dealing with Searching the World Wide Web, with a real example using the AltaVista search engine and Boolean expressions (Example 1.1.14) A logic game (Example 1.3.17) Using the matrix of a relation to determine whether the relation is transitive (Example 2.6.7) Pseudorandom number generators (Example 2.8.14) The Melissa virus (as an example of combinatorial explosion) (Example 4.1.2) The birthday problem (Example 4.5.7) Telemarketing (Example 4.5.21) Detecting the HIV virus (Example 4.5.22) Computer file systems (Example 7.1.6). The new section reviews, which precede the exercises in every section, consist of exercises with answers in the back of the book. These exercises review the key concepts, definitions, theorems, techniques, and so on, of the section. Although intended for reviews of the sections, section reviews can also be used for placement and pretesting.

Three principal aspects of combinatorial reasoning are emphasized in this book: the systematic analysis of different possibilities, the exploration of the logical structure of a problem, and ingenuity. Keeping theory to a minimum, it uses numerical examples to demonstrate the combinatorial reasoning involved in computer science, operations research, and finite probability. This edition gives more attention to computer science&#39;s use of combinatorics. Includes a new chapter on topics in theoretical computer science, a new section on recursive programs, an enlarged discussion of algorithms to generate combinatorial sets, and additional programming exercises.</p><p></p><h2>Not by Design: Retiring Darwin&#x2019;s Watchmaker</h2><p>More than two centuries ago, William Paley introduced his famous metaphor of the universe as a watch made by the Creator. For Paley, the exquisite structure of the universe necessitated a designer. Today, some 150 years since Darwin's <i>On the Origin of Species</i> was published, the argument of design is seeing a revival. This provocative work tells how Darwin left the door open for this revival--and at the same time argues for a new conceptual framework that avoids the problematic teleology inherent in Darwin's formulation of natural selection. In a wide-ranging discussion of the historical and philosophical dimensions of evolutionary theory from the ancient Greeks to today, John Reiss argues that we should look to the principle of the <i>conditions for existence,</i> first formulated before <i>On the Origin of Species</i> by the French paleontologist Georges Cuvier, to clarify the relation of adaptation to evolution. Reiss suggests that Cuvier's principle can help resolve persistent issues in evolutionary biology, including the proper definition of natural selection, the distinction between natural selection and genetic drift, and the meaning of genetic load. Moreover, he shows how this principle can help unite diverse areas of biology, ranging from quantitative genetics and the theory of the levels of selection to evo-devo, ecology, physiology, and conservation biology.</p><p>"Charles Darwin described natural selection in two ways: devoid of purpose or direction and as a teleological agent sorting through heritable variation. Evolutionary biologists today repeat Darwin's divergent rhetoric. In this fine book, John Reiss helps us to rid all teleology from evolutionary biology."&#x2014;William Provine, Cornell University<br><br>"Anyone who thinks they understand how natural selection works as an evolutionary process ought to read this book.

In the ninth century, the Khazarian royalty and nobility, as well as a significant portion of the Khazarian population embraced the Jewish religion. This volume traces the develpment of the Khazars from their early beginnings as a tribe to the decline and fall of their kingdom. It also examines the many migrations of the Khazar people into Hungary, Ukraine, and other areas of Europe and their subsequent assimilation, providing the most comprehensive treatment of this complex issue to date. The Jews of Khazaria draws upon the latest archival, linguistic, and archaeological discoveries. Ashkenazic Jews who wish to explore their distant ancestry in eastern Europe will benefit from reading this book.</p><p>February 2018 update: Chapter 10&#39;s statement about Polish women contributing to Ashkenazic DNA was further confirmed, as the book went to press, by the discovery of the Ashkenazic mtDNA haplogroup J1c7a in the Kowalewko cemetery in Iron Age Poland (data gathered for the study &#34;A mosaic genetic structure of the human population living in the South Baltic region during the Iron Age&#34;).Kevin Alan Brook is an historian in Connecticut who has researched the Khazars since 1993. He has contributed articles about the Khazars to The Encyclopaedia of Judaism Supplement One (2003) and The Turks, Vol. 1 (2002). His article &#39;The Origins of East European Jews&#39; appeared in volume 30 of the journal Russian History/Histoire Russe. Since 1995, Brook has maintained the website of the American Center of Khazar Studies (Khazaria.com).</p><h2>Encyclopedia of Ferns: An Introduction to Ferns, Their Structure, Biology, Economic Importance, Cultivation and Propagation</h2><p>This encyclopedia is really two books: the first half is a complete guide to the botany, cultivation, propagation, and pests and diseases of ferns; and the second half, &#34;Ferns to Grow,&#34; provides growing information for hundreds of species. Excellent color photos, diagrams, and line drawings complement the lucid text.</p><p>This handsome fern book is intended for gardeners, not botanists, although it does include quite a lot of botanical information and descriptions of over 700 fern species. The rest of the book covers structure, culture and propagation, and diseases and pests. Two particularly useful features are a list of ferns suitable for various habitats both indoors and out, and an international list of fern societies and study groups.

One of the founding works of Language Poetry, <i>The Age of </i><i>Huts </i>is about everything, more or less literally, as each sentence, even each phrase, embarks on its own narrative, linking together to form a large polyphonic investigation of contemporary life. From <i>Ketjak, </i>one of the first poems to employ "the new sentence," to <i>2197, </i>a serial work that scrambles the vocabulary and grammar of its sentences, <i>The </i> <i>Age of Huts </i>questions everything we have known about poetry in order to see the world anew.</p><p>"It would be impossible to overestimate the importance of Ron Silliman's <i>Age of Huts</i>; it was ground-breaking when it first began to appear, piecemeal, a quarter of a century ago, and it remains a revolutionary work today.

Bill Berkson writes that if "David Park was the classicist of the founding triad of the Bay Area Figurative painters, and Richard Diebenkorn the modernist, Bischoff was the romantic." Designed to accompany a major retrospective of Bischoff's work, this superb volume is lavishly illustrated with duotones and color plates that faithfully capture the subtle variations in shade that characterize the painter's oeuvre. Berkson and Susan Landauer, both of whom knew Bischoff, provide the definitive view of the life, art, and teaching career of this important artist.<br><br> Native to the Bay Area, Bischoff studied at the University of California under the "Berkeley School" modernists Worth Ryder, Erle Loran, and Margaret Peterson. His experience during World War II profoundly affected his view of the world and his place in it. In 1946, Bischoff joined the faculty of the California School of Fine Arts where--with colleagues Edward Corbett, Richard Diebenkorn, Claire Falkenstein, David Park, Ad Reinhardt, Mark Rothko, Hassel Smith, and Clyfford Still--he found himself at the hub of avant-garde expression in the Bay Area. Throughout his career, Bischoff applied his visual intelligence and unusual personal integrity in creating a uniquely varied body of work that invites our investigation.<br><br> Having interviewed many of the artist's surviving colleagues and family members, Landauer offers valuable primary documentation on Bischoff, the Bay Area Figurative School, and the cultural history of the Northern California art scene. Her lively text is supported with insightful research into the social and political background of the period. She considers Bischoff's career in relation to the European artists who influenced him, his interactions with his local contemporaries, and his reactions to the New York art scene. A useful chronology of the artist's life, a bibliography, and documentary photographs that Landauer uncovered during her research make this volume an invaluable resource for anyone interested in the artistic vision of Elmer Bischoff.</p><p>"Elmer Bischoff is one of the small handful of truly fine artists at mid-century and beyond working in Northern California. His art is of national importance. In Susan Landauer he has the author who can bring his life and art to us."&#x2015;Walter Hopps, Twentieth Century Curator, The Menil Collection <br><br>"This first substantial monograph on Elmer Bischoff offers a warm appraisal of a deacon of West Coast painters, justly celebrated for his lifelong navigation of the "tightrope" between abstract painting's sensual materiality and the ethical implications of a figurative art. Susan Landauer meets her own high standards of nuanced social history, and Bill Berkson's brief introduction is studded with gems."&#x2015;Caroline Jones, author of <i>Bay Area Figurative Art </i> <br><br>"Susan Landauer&#x2019;s new monograph is a welcome addition to Twentieth Century Bay Area art history. She is a specialist, who explores the life and work, attitudes and ideals of this important artist, his European and American influences, in parallel with those of his famous colleagues, Richard Diebenkorn and David Park. She brings historical understanding and esthetic subtlety to the study as she digs into the artist&#x2019;s esthetic and educational philosophy, the relation between painting and improvised jazz, temporary blocks and personal crises, as well as his complete reinventions of his drawing and painting. All this is set in the context of the life of art in the Bay Area community (1940-1990) and results in a readable work of value to professionals while remaining accessible to more casual readers."&#x2015;Gerald Nordland, author of <i>Richard Diebenkorn </i><b>Susan Landauer</b> is Katie and Drew Gibson Chief Curator at the San Jose Museum of Art in San Jose, California.

America is rapidly graying: between now and 2030, the number of people in the U.S. over the age of 80 is expected to almost triple. But how long people live raises the question of how <em>well</em> they live. <br><br><em>Aging Our Way</em> follows the everyday lives of 30 elders (ages 85-102) living at home and mostly alone to understand how they create and maintain meaningful lives for themselves. Drawing on the latest interdisciplinary scholarship on aging and three years of interviews with the elders, Meika Loe explores how elders navigate the practical challenges of living as independently as possible while staying healthy, connected, and comfortable. While most books on the subject treat old age as a social problem and elders as simply diminished versions of their former selves, <em>Aging Our Way</em> views them as they really are: lively, complicated, engaging people finding creative ways to make their aging as meaningful and manageable as possible. In their own voices, elders describe how they manage everything from grocery shopping, doctor appointments, and disability, to creating networks of friends and maintaining their autonomy. In many ways, these elders can serve as role models. The lessons they have learned about living in moderation, taking time for themselves, asking for help, keeping a sense of humor, caring for others, and preparing for death provide an invaluable source of wisdom for anyone hoping to live a long and fulfilling life. Through their stories, Loe helps us to think about aging, well-being, and the value of human relationships in new ways. <br><br>Written with remarkable warmth and depth of understanding, <em>Aging Our Way</em> offers a vivid look at a group of people who too often remain invisible--those who have lived the longest--and all they have to teach us.<br></p><p><p></p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: An Excerpt from <i>Aging Our Way: Lessons for Living from 85 and Beyond</i></strong> <p></p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ann Donohue with author Meika Loe</td> </tr> <tr> </tr> </tbody></table> <p></p> <p></p><p></p>Dear Reader, <p></p>I remember reading an autobiography of Eva Le Gallienne, the actress.

He had also suffered a series of painful physical, economic, and emotional losses. The Mysterious Stranger, published posthumously in 1916 and belonging to Twain&#39;s &#34;dark&#34; period, belies the popular image of the affable American humorist. In this antireligious tale, Twain denies the existence of a benign Providence, a soul, an afterlife, and even reality itself. As the Stranger in the story asserts, &#34;nothing exists; all is a dream&#34;.<b>MARK TWAIN&nbsp;</b>was born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in Florida, Missouri, on November 30, 1835, the son of John Marshall Clemens, an avowed freethinker, and his wife, Jane, a believer and connoisseur of the occult. These two opposing forces&#x2014;freethought and spiritualism&#x2014;colored the young Twain's view of the world and would later serve as material for his books.<br><br>As a child, Twain knew both violence and tragedy. In the town of Hannibal, Missouri, where he lived from 1839 to 1853, shootings and attempted shootings were not unusual events. Twain's older brother Benjamin died when Twain was only six; a few months later, the family lost their home to debt. When Twain was twelve, his father died.<br><br>It was at this time that Twain left school to go to work in order to help his financially strapped family, first as a printer's apprentice and later as a journeyman printer; he was also a river pilot, a prospector, and a roving newspaper reporter. Twain's journalistic travels took him throughout the United States as well as to South America, Europe, and the Middle East, from where he sent back entertaining travel letters. While a reporter for the Virginia City&nbsp;<i>Territorial&nbsp;</i>Enterprise, he adopted the pen name Mark Twain. His scathing, observant articles began to earn him a wide and loyal readership. Samuel Clemens/Mark Twain made his readers, and later his listeners during his lecture tours, familiar with his life: skill�fully blending the real and the fictional, he created the char�acter of Mark Twain whom Americans&#x2014;and the world&#x2014;recognized and loved in his many books, including&nbsp;<i>The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras&nbsp;</i>County, and Other&nbsp;<i>Sketches&nbsp;</i>(1867);&nbsp;<i>Innocents Abroad (1869); Roughing It&nbsp;</i>(1872);&nbsp;<i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876);&nbsp;</i>and his masterpiece,&nbsp;<i>Adventures</i>&nbsp;<i>of Huckleberry Finn&nbsp;</i>(1884).<br><br>Eulogized by William Dean Howells as "the Lincoln of our literature," Twain achieved great fame from his writing and earned a fortune. He lost this, however, following his involvement in a failed publishing house venture; thereafter, Twain lectured to clear his debts. The final two decades of Twain's life were marked, as were his first years, by a series of tragedies: during these years he lost in quick succession his beloved wife, Livy; a favorite nephew; his daughters Susy and Jean; and his sister, Pamela. Twain had toyed with the idea that life is a dream and that human emotions and expe�riences are delusions. His work at this time reflects his grow�ing gloominess, pessimism, and contempt for organized reli�gion: Extracts from&nbsp;<i>Adam's Diary&nbsp;</i>(1904) and&nbsp;<i>Eve's Diary&nbsp;</i>(1906) satirized Scripture;&nbsp;<i>Christian Science&nbsp;</i>(1907) ridiculed Mark Baker Eddy's new religion. This is the period, too, of Twain's vitriolic&nbsp;<i>Letters from the Earth&nbsp;</i>(1906; first published in 1962) and&nbsp;<i>The Mysterious&nbsp;</i>Stranger, several versions of which were written during 1905-06 and which was posthu�mously published in 1916. Here Twain denies the existence of a benign Providence, a soul, or an afterlife. Indeed, reality itself is taken away as the Stranger in this antireligious tale&#x2014;the angel-boy, Satan&#x2014;asserts that "nothing exists; all is a dream." This and the other works of Twain's last years belie that popular image of the easy, affable American humorist; they reveal instead a man engaged in an often tortuous strug�gle to discover what life is and what meaning, if any, it holds.<br><br>Mark Twain died in Redding, Connecticut, on April 21, 1910.</p><h2>Economics U$A</h2><p><p><strong>Widely renowned for its seamless integration of textbook and video learning, <em>Economics U$A</em> is one of the most successful telecourses ever produced.</strong></p> Now available in a carefully revised and updated Seventh Edition, the text continues to emphasize the real-world applications of the most current economic principles and data in a clear and inviting format.

The role of project management in the modern organization has grown significantly. The effective management of project portfolios that include numerous short-terms projects, large multi-project programs or both has become a growing challenge for industry, government and other institutions. Many organizations have identified a need to formalize the practice of project management and develop centers of coordination and excellence for project management. The Program Management Office is a guide to satisfying this need for improved coordination, standardization, optimization, and management of the practice of project management. It addresses the strategic and practical aspects of establishing and managing the program management office (PMO) including how to create a clear and compelling business case for the PMO and sell the business case to management, how to design, structure, and implement a PMO, and how to clearly demonstrate the value provided by the PMO once operational. The text also addresses a number of common challenges that management, PMO implementation teams, and PMO staff often struggle with as they develop, implement, and manage a PMO. The early chapters of this book provide step by step instructions to those interested in implementing and managing an effective PMO. The later chapters provide practical guidance to those who already work in a functioning PMO on how to improve PMO performance as well as its value to the organization. The author proposes that the PMO serve three primary missions &#x2014; standards, consulting and knowledge. He discusses these three domains in detail and provides an understanding of why each is important as well as how the PMO can best serve each of these missions to maximize value to the organization. The Program Management Office: Establishing, Managing and Growing the Value of a PMO is an outstanding guide for those interested in starting a PMO or in growing the value of an existing PMO. It is also an ideal text for project management course instruction on the subject of PMOs.</p><p>Craig J.

An important cultural and historical work, the book recounts Gottschalk's experiences as he traveled and performed throughout the last decade of his life.</p><br><p> Born to an English-Jewish father and a Haitian mother, Gottschalk is remembered as one of the great New Orleans musicians and composers, his music a combination of the classical tradition in which he was trained, and the New Orleans tradition into which he was born. His art form took him far outside the boundaries of Louisiana, however. While still a child, he studied piano in Paris and gave a concert at the Salle Pleyel, after which Fr�d�ric Chopin is said to have remarked: "Give me your hand, my child; I predict that you will become the king of pianists." Gottschalk returned to the United States in 1853, and later lived in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Panama, and South America, during which time he kept-sometimes sporadically, sometimes daily--the notebooks that formed the basis of <i>Notes of a Pianist</i>.</p><br><p> Published for the first time in 1881, the book continues to resonate with American cultural and musical life. <i>Notes of a Pianist</i> demonstrates Gottschalk's importance not only as a reporter of the musical life and tastes of Americans during the Civil War, but also as a forefather of Louisiana's rich musical culture.</p></p><p><p>"In his autobiographical <i>Notes of a Pianist</i>, nineteenth-century New Orleans piano virtuoso and composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk shares with us his impressions as he travels through North and South America. His concert schedule and the number of cities he visits in a year during the age of locomotive and steamship would be daunting to even the most travel-hardened jet-age road warrior. Whether at a railroad siding worrying about the fate of his precious Chickering concert grand pianos before the Civil War battle of Gettysburg, fleeing San Francisco for South America because of a concocted scandal, or tending the wounded during the revolution in Lima, Peru, Gottschalk puts the reader in the middle of the action. His writing style is like his music--bold, colorful, romantic, virtuosic, and dramatic."<b>--Lambert Orkis, Grammy Award-winning pianist</b></p><p>"Having grown up in opera-mad New Orleans in a household in which Creole tunes were probably common currency, Louis Moreau Gottschalk, after finishing school in Paris, gave free rein to his captivating and spontaneous fantasy and melodic charm. As Frederick Starr convincingly shows, his music was brilliant and original. And it leaves, when sympathetically presented, an indelible impression of his genius."<b>--Lawrence Gushee, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, author of <i>Pioneers of Jazz: The Story of the Creole Band</i></b></p><p>"Over and above all [the] purely sensuous aspects of [Gottschalk's] pianism . . . Was the presence of a genuinely musical soul. This was what most commanded the admiration of his friend and mentor Hector Berlioz: his musicianship, his taste, and his fine sense of proportion."<b>--From the editor's Prelude</b></p><b>Jeanne Behrend</b> (1912-1988) was a composer and concert pianist who specialized in American music.

In short, we have become the dominant animal. Why, then, are we creating a world that threatens our own species? What can we do to change the current trajectory toward more climate change, increased famine, and epidemic disease?<br> &nbsp;<br> Renowned Stanford scientists Paul R. Ehrlich and Anne H. Ehrlich believe that intelligently addressing those questions depends on a clear understanding of how we evolved and how and why we&#x2019;re changing the planet in ways that darken our descendants&#x2019; future. The Dominant Animal arms readers with that knowledge, tracing the interplay between environmental change and genetic and cultural evolution since the dawn of humanity. In lucid and engaging prose, they describe how Homo sapiens adapted to their surroundings, eventually developing the vibrant cultures, vast scientific knowledge, and technological wizardry we know today.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the Ehrlichs also explore the flip side of this triumphant story of innovation and conquest. As we clear forests to raise crops and build cities, lace the continents with highways, and create chemicals never before seen in nature, we may be undermining our own supremacy. The threats of environmental damage are clear from the daily headlines, but the outcome is far from destined. Humanity can again adapt&#x2014;if we learn from our evolutionary past.<br> &nbsp;<br> Those lessons are crystallized in The Dominant Animal. Tackling the fundamental challenge of the human predicament, Paul and Anne Ehrlich offer a vivid and unique exploration of our origins, our evolution, and our future.</p><p><p>Paul R. Ehrlich is Bing Professor of Population Studies and professor of&nbsp;biology at Stanford University and a fellow of the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics. The author of <i>Human Natures</i>, <i>The Population Bomb</i>, and many other books, he is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a recipient of numerous international honors, including the Crafoord Prize and the MacArthur &#x201c;genius award.&#x201d;</p><p>Anne H. Ehrlich is affiliated with Stanford's Biology Department and Center for Conservation Biology, and is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She has served on the board of the Sierra Club and other conservation organizations, has coauthored more than ten books with her husband, and is a recipient of the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement and the United Nations Environment Programme/Sasakawa Environment Prize.</p><br>"No one has more authority to write on these matters than the husband-and-wife team of Stanford biologists Paul and Anne Ehrlich. For decades now they have been documenting and warning of humans' effects on the environment. Their new book, <i>The Dominant Animal</i>, continues their chronicle of the damage we have done to our home.... This is an important book,with much information and some really stimulating ideas. We need to build on these ideas, because the world is in an environmental mess and things are not getting better." (<i><i>The Washington Post</i></i>)<br><br>"[The Ehrlichs] argue clearly and convincingly ... this fascinating, inspiring book [deserves a] wide audience." (<i><i>Publishers Weekly</i></i>)<br><br>"...<i>The Dominant Animal</i> tells the story of how mankind came to dominate nearly every inch of the earth. [It] spans the entire history of the world, weaving both cultural and biological evolution into the ambitious narrative. At its core are timely questions we would all do well to consider: Is it in our best interest to dominate Earth? Are we creating a future we want to live in?" (<i><i>Plenty Magazine</i></i>)<br><br>"While the world suffers from natural disasters, inflated energy costs, and unsustainable consumption patterns, the Ehrlichs make hopeful suggestions for sustainability and reduced vulnerability." (<i><i>Library Journal</i></i>)<br><br>"Alpha male and female of contemporary science ... the Ehrlichs convey a message at once chilling and hopeful.... The big ideas and the tenor of <i>The Dominant Animal</i> are right on. The book rejects starry eyed insistence on new technology as humankind's savior in favor of socially responsible, if admittedly difficult-to-enact, prescriptions." (<i><i>SEED Magazine</i></i>)<br><br>"Their latest book, <i>The Dominant Animal: Human Evolution and the Environment</i>, continues to drum home the message that humans are on a collision course with ecological catastrophe. But what's new and notable is the dual biological and cultural lens the Ehrlichs use to diagnose the underlying cause of our predicament... the book left me wanting more&#x2014;hungry for revolutionary new insights whose very existence would shine the right way forward. If we'd listened to Ehrlich 40 years ago, perhaps we'd already be on that path." (<i><i>Audubon</i></i>)<br><br>"Covering a vast swathe of disciplines, from genetics, evolution and ecology to climatology, economics and global politics, the book almost reads like a primer for the concerned citizen.... This marvellous compendium should be required reading." (<i><i>New Scientist</i></i>)<br><br>"The Ehrlichs, in <i>The Dominant Animal</i>, cover an enormous amount of scientific ground in looking at both the big picture in terms of environmental dangers and challenges while also offering detailed explanations of how humans have evolved, both genetically and culturally, within our environment. The book relates precise science in easily understandable terms." (<i><i>Palo Alto Weekly</i></i>)<br><br>"Buy this for your next seminar class.... or be inspired and make an undergraduate course out of it...Yes, you've read some of this before, but not all of it, and not told so well, or with such passion and humor."

With the same down-to-earth charm and wit that have endeared her to her many students and readers, Boorstein shows how one can be both an observant Jew and a passionately committed Buddhist.</p><p>Sylvia Boorstein, teaches mindfulness and leads retreats across the United States. She is a co-founding teacher at Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Woodacre, California, and a senior teacher at the Insight Meditation Center in Barre, Massachusetts. Boorstein is also a practicing psychotherapist.

They have two sons, two daughters, and five grandchildren.<p><b>One More River</b></p><br><p>I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE QUESTIONS MOST ASKED of me by Jews are "how" questions. I am recognized as a Buddhist. I am also-and have become much more open about this part in the last few years-an observant Jew. No only more open, but also more observant. Because I am a Buddhist. <i>Because</i> I have a meditation practice. So the questions now are: "How did that happen?" "What is your practice?" "Do you pray?" "To whom?" "Why?" "Do you also do <i>metta</i> (lovingkindness) practice?" "When do you do what?" "Why?" "What are your'observances,'and why do you do them?" "How do you deal with the patriarchal tone of Jewish prayers?" 'What is your relationship to the Torah?" 'To Buddhist scripture?" Most of all, "How can you be a Buddhist and a Jew?" And, 'Can I?"</p><p>The answer to the "how" questions requires that I tell my personal story. Certainly not my story as a prescription for anyone else, but to explain how my Buddhism has made me more passionately alive as a Jew. And how my re newed Judaism has made me a better Buddhist teacher.</p><p>When I realized the degree of personal exposure that telling my story would require, I became alarmed that I was going to rock the boat. I had been quietly enjoying a privat life as a Jew and some new, pleasant recognition as a Buddhist teacher. I had been accepting invitations for som years to teach Jewish groups, and although I had worried initially that they would be hostile about my Buddhism, they weren't. They invited me back. Then I worried about the Buddhists.</p><p>"What if the Buddhists get mad at me for not renouncing Judaism?"</p><p>Clearly, this was <i>my</i> issue, not anyone else's. No one is mad at me. I've been announcing myself, regularly, at Buddhist teachers' meetings, and it causes no ripple at all. I feel anticipatory alarm, I tell my truth, and it is completely a nonevent.</p><p>Recently I was one of twenty-six teachers meeting with the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India, to discuss how we are teaching Buddhism in the West. As part of the preparation for our meeting, we each answered the question, "What is the greatest current spiritual challenge in your practice and teaching?"</p><p>I thought, "Okay, this is it! These are major teachers in all lineages, these are people I respect and who I hope will respect me." And I said my truth: "I am a Jew. These days I spend a lot of my time teaching Buddhist meditation to Jews. It gives me special pleasure to teach Jews, and sometimes special problems. I feel it's my calling, though, something I'm supposed to do. And I'm worried that someone here will think I'm doing something wrong. Someone will say, 'You're not a <i>real</i> Buddhist!"'</p><p>It was another nonevent. I think-I hope-that was the "One Last River to Cross." I never did ask the Dalai Lama if what I am doing is okay. It had become, for me, a nonquestion by the time we got to our meetings with him. My particular group discussed "Lay and Monastic Practice in the West," and I did say, "I am a Jew, and monasticism is not part of Jewish tradition." I'm not entirely sure of the context in which I made that remark. It may not have been completely relevant to the discussion. Perhaps it was prompted by my desire to make <i>sure</i> I made my declaration publicly, in Dharamsala to the Dalai Lama, just in case that might emerge later as "one more river."</p><p>The three-hour return taxi ride from Dharamsala to Pathankot was occasionally hair-raising. Indian taxis are truly dangerous. Accidents, fatal ones, are common. I was sitting in front with the driver, trying to maintain some composure in the face of many last-minute reprieves. As we passed through one particular section of narrow mountain road, there were a few swerves that brought the taxi very close to the edge.</p><p>My friend Jack Komfield was sitting with Steve Smith and Heinz Roiger in the backseat.</p><p>Jack said, "I hope you are saying protection mantras, Sylvia."</p><p>I said, "Of course I am."</p><p>He said, "Are they Jewish mantras or Buddhist mantras?"</p><p>I said, "Both."</p><p>Jack laughed. "Good."</p><p><b>I Am a Jew and I Am a Buddhist</b></p><br><p>I AM A JEW BECAUSE MY PARPNTS WERE MILD-MANNERED, cheerful best friends who loved me enormously, and they were Jews. It's my karma. It's good karma. My parents' love included respect, admiration, high expectations, and a tremendous amount of permission. I can't remember ever being scolded.</p><p>I am a prayerful, devout Jew because I am a Buddhist. As the meditation practice that I learned from my Buddhist teachers made me less fearful and allowed me to fall in love with life, I discovered that the prayer language of "thank-you" that I knew from my childhood returned, spontaneously and to my great delight. From the very first day of my very first Buddhist meditation retreat, from the very first time I heard the Buddha's elegant and succinct teachings about the possibility of the end of suffering-not the end of pain, but the end of suffering-I was captivated, I was thrilled, and I was reassured. The idea that it was possible, in the middle of this very life, fully engaged in life, to live contentedly and compassionately was completely compelling. I felt better even before I <i>was</i> better.</p><p>It took me a long time, even after I had begun to teach Buddhist meditation, to get ready to say, "I am a Buddhist." I often hesitated. I circumlocuted. I said, when pressed to identify myself, "I am a Dharma teacher," or "I teach Buddhist psychology," or "I am a Buddhist meditation teacher." To say, "I am a Buddhist" seemed too much like taking a plunge that I didn't need to take.</p></p><h2>Student Activities Manual for �Arriba!: Comunicaci�n y cultura</h2><p><p>The <b> <i>�Arriba!</i> </b> <b>Student Activities Manual,</b> available both in print and within <b>MySpanishLab</b>, includes a vast number of practice activities, many of which are audio- or video-based, for each chapter of the text.

But ecological artworks were not limited to conventional understandings of environmental art as something that had to be located outdoors or made of organic materials. Created in a range of media, they reflected a widespread reconceptualization of the material world and a sense of the interconnectedness of all things. In this book, James Nisbet investigates the many levels of intersection between ecology and art in the 1960s and 1970s, examining a series of works that served as sensory interfaces to ecological concepts and reflected the shifting notions of ecology during the period.</p><p>Nisbet first examines practices of land art that sought to revise the relationship of art to the biological world. He explores the all-but-forgotten genre of Environments, founded by Allan Kaprow, which produced both closed environments bounded by the gallery's walls and psychedelic multimedia environments; and he examines the transition between minimalism and land art, considering the &#x201c;planetary visions&#x201d; that cast singular objects within holistic ecosystems&#x2015;a sensibility that infused such canonical earthworks as Michael Heizer's <i>Double Negative</i> and Robert Smithson's <i>Spiral Jetty</i>. Nisbet then turns to work informed by the language of energy and the ecological notion that all matter is in process, including Robert Barry's radio wave installations and Simone Forti's performances. Finally, he considers Walter De Maria's <i>The Lightning Field</i>, finding in it a reflection of the conflicts within ecological thinking of the 1970s. Offering a radically new view of environmental art, Nisbet traces a cultural turn from an art that addresses artificially confined environments and simplified allegories of the planet to one that increasingly takes on the &#x201c;unruly complexities&#x201d; of global ecologies.</p></p><p>James Nisbet is Assistant Professor in the Department of Art History at the University of California, Irvine.<p>Amalgamating the worlds of art and science, Nisbet demonstrates the impossibility of collapsing land art into ecology while making a case for the importance of an evolving lived experience with situated works and with the persistent traces they leave in history through images, films, sounds, and texts.</p>&#x2015;<b>Chris Taylor</b>, Director of Land Arts of the American West at Texas Tech University<br><br><p>Nisbet's inspiringly capacious conception of the settings for environmental and land art persuades the reader of his hypothesis, which is that the works in question are greatly more open&#x2015;conceptually, constitutionally, and communicatively&#x2015;than inherited frameworks for understanding them would have us believe. This study perceives afresh how a multidisciplinary crowd of modernist artists achieved constructions that were entirely coextensive with their enclosing environments, be those natural or unnatural. <i>Ecologies, Environments, and Energy Systems in Art of the 1960s and 1970s</i> is remarkably timely, too, for articulating its subjects' far-reaching significance for the challenges of the present moment.</p>&#x2015;<b>Darby English</b>, Clark Art Institute<br><br><p>James Nisbet narrates the history of American art of the sixties and seventies from an ecological perspective. He suggests that the discussion of art and ecology exceeds the question of art and sustainability, defining 'ecology' not as a closed environment but as an open system of exchanges. He argues that an ecological imaginary theorized by Rachel Carson, Gregory Bateson, and many others was concurrently manifest in a number of aesthetic tendencies&#x2015;Kaprow's environments, the process sculpture of Morris and Serra, Haacke's and Barry's conceptualism, the performative activities of Nauman and Oppenheim, and the earthworks of Heizer, Smithson, and De Maria&#x2015;in which distinctions between object, gallery and site, process and information, and the body and artwork become porous and blur. His well-researched account sheds new light on these and other practices, and the intellectual and cultural milieu in which they emerged.</p>&#x2015;<b>James Meyer</b>, author of <i>Minimalism: Art and Polemics in the Sixties</i></p><h2>Canterbury Tales</h2><p>This is a reproduction of a book published before 1923.

Among them is a knight, a monk, a prioress, a plowman, a miller, a merchant, a clerk, and an oft-widowed wife from Bath. Travel is arduous and wearing; to maintain their spirits, this band of pilgrims entertains each other with a series of tall tales that span the spectrum of literary genres. Five hundred years later, people are still reading Geoffrey Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>.

Cox, Editor-in-Chief</i></p><h2>Chrysler: The Life and Times of an Automotive Genius</h2><p>Here is a richly detailed account of one of the most important men in American automotive history, based on full access to both Chrysler Corporation and Chrysler family historical records. <br> Chrysler emerges as a man who loved machines, an accomplished mechanic who also had highly developed managerial skills derived from half a lifetime on the railroads, a man whose success came from his deep understanding of engineering and his total commitment to the quality of his vehicles. Vincent Curcio traces Chrysler's rise from a locomotive wiper in a Kansas roundhouse to the head of the Buick Division of General Motors, to his rescue of the Maxwell-Chalmers car company, which led to the successful development of the 1924 Chrysler--the world's first modern car--and the formation of Chrysler Corporation in 1925. Chrysler was quite different from the other auto giants--a colorful and expansive man, deeply involved in the design of his cars, a maverick in establishing his headquarters in New York City, in the world's most famous art deco structure, the fabled Chrysler Building, which he built and helped to design. Because of his emphasis on quality at popular prices, the company weathered the Great Depression with flying colors--losing money only in the rock-bottom year of 1932--and despite the market fiasco of the Chrysler Airflow (which was years ahead of its time), the company grew and remained profitable right up to Chrysler's death in 1940. <br> The definitive portrait, <em>Walter P. Chrysler</em> is must reading for all car enthusiasts and for everyone interested in the story of a giant of industry.</p><p>It takes a while to get used to Vincent Curcio's highly colored prose, but his old-fashioned narrative technique suits his subject, the Kansas railroad mechanic who rose to become head of America's most dynamic car company. Born in 1875, Walter P. Chrysler came late to the automobile business, joining Buick in 1912, when the early companies were firmly established. Chrysler made his mark by being a great leader who thoroughly understood engineering and production, and who valued the contributions of his employees and directed them to produce high-quality, popularly priced cars. He made it his business to ignore conventional wisdom: he headquartered his company in New York instead of Detroit, commissioned a fabulous art deco skyscraper to house it, and introduced the first mass-produced, streamlined, aerodynamic car in 1934. The Airflow was a financial disaster but hugely influential on future design, and the well-managed Chrysler Corporation made money even during the Great Depression. Chrysler himself became enormously wealthy and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle during the decade before his death in 1940. Curcio's detailed, wide-ranging text offers an instructive history of the automobile industry as well as a full-bodied portrait of a classic American individual, praised by his peers as "one of the world's greatest manufacturers and one of the world's best men." <i>--Wendy Smith</i><br><strong>Vincent Curcio</strong>, a veteran theatrical manager-producer, is the author of <em>Suicide Blonde</em>, a biography of Gloria Grahame.

To the accounts of these voyages by John Brereton and James Rosier there was added by Purchas in 1625 the material of Martin Pring&#39;s voyage of 1603 and some scraps of information on the attempted colony by the Virginia Company of Plymouth at Sagadahoc on the Kennebec River in 1607-1608. The narrative of the voyage of the Mary and John, discovered in the 19th century, and now attributed to Robert Davies, remains our main authority for the 1607 voyage. Many ancillary documents are added to these essential sources. Most of these narratives have been edited in the distant past but they are now furnished with full information on fauna, flora, and above all, ethnography. The material which has become available on Indians of both northern and southern New England has enabled a full account to be given of them, while expert advice has been obtained in the edition of the Eastern Abenaki vocabulary of 1605. Considerable attention has been paid to topographical problems, to which new solutions are offered in a number of cases (though conflicting views are discussed in an appendix). The volume thus makes up a collection which is basic for the understanding of how Englishmen began to explore New England (and how its inhabitants learnt something of the English) and on how that important territory first came to light in detail. The narratives are of great interest in themselves and the biographical information which it has been possible to assemble in the introduction about a number of the authors and actors in the voyages and the colonising attempt of 1607 is valuable in enabling the reader to understand what they wrote and what they omitted. Professor and Mrs Quinn have worked on this volume for a number of years and their introduction and notes constitute an important addition to our knowledge.</p><p>David B. Quinn and Alison M.

Every single one of his 11 steps either was historically part of what built America&#x20ac;&#x2122;s greatness in the past (such as enforcing the Sherman Act and breaking up big corporations or returning to a tariff-based trade policy), or has worked well in other nations (like a national single-payer healthcare system &#x20ac;&#x201d;Medicare Part "E" for "Everybody"&#x20ac;&#x201d;or encouraging the growth of worker-owned cooperatives like the $6 billion Mondragon cooperative in Spain).Hartmann's solutions are essentially nonpartisan.

This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power.<br><br> &#x2014;Thomas Jefferson, letter to William<br><br> Charles Jarvis, September 28, 1820<br><br> ON APRIL 14, 1789, GEORGE WASHINGTON WAS OUT WALKING through the fields at Mount Vernon, his home in Virginia, when Charles Thomson, the secretary of the Continental Congress, rode up on horseback. Thomson had a letter for Washington from the president pro tempore of the new, constitutionally created United States Senate, telling Washington that he&#x2019;d just been elected president and the inauguration was set for April 30 in the nation&#x2019;s capital, New York City.1<br><br> This created two problems for Washington.<br><br> The first was saying goodbye to his 82-year-old mother, which the 57-year-old Washington did that night. She gave him her blessing and told him it was the last time he&#x2019;d see her alive, as she was gravely ill; and, indeed, she died before he returned from New York.<br><br> The second problem was finding a suit of clothes made in America. For that he sent a courier to his old friend and fellow general from the American Revolutionary War, Henry Knox.<br><br> Washington couldn&#x2019;t find a suit made in America because in the years prior to the American Revolution, the British East India Company (whose tea was thrown into Boston Harbor by outraged colonists after the Tea Act of 1773 gave the world&#x2019;s largest transnational corporation a giant tax break) controlled the manufacture and the transportation of a whole range of goods, including fine clothing. Cotton and wool could be grown and sheared in the colonies, but it had to be sent to England to be turned into clothes.<br><br> This was a routine policy for England, and it is why until India achieved its independence in 1947 Mahatma Gandhi (who was assassinated a year later) sat with his spinning wheel for his lectures and spun daily in his own home. It was, like his Salt March, a protest against the colonial practices of England and an entreaty to his fellow Indians to make their own clothes to gain independence from British companies and institutions.<br><br> Fortunately for George Washington, an American clothing company had been established on April 28, 1783, in Hartford, Connecticut, by a man named Daniel Hinsdale, and it produced high-quality woolen and cotton clothing as well as items made from imported silk.2 It was to Hinsdale&#x2019;s company that Knox turned, and he helped Washington get&#x2014;in time for his inauguration two weeks later&#x2014;a nice, but not excessively elegant, brown American-made suit. (He wore British black later for the celebrations and the most famous painting.)<br><br> When Washington became president in 1789, most of America&#x2019;s personal and industrial products of any significance were manufactured in England or in its colonies. Washington asked his Treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, what could be done about that, and Hamilton came up with an 11-point plan to foster American manufacturing, which he presented to Congress in 1791. By 1793 most of its points had either been made into law by Congress or formulated into policy by either President Washington or the various states, which put the country on a path of developing its industrial base and generating the largest source of federal revenue for more than a hundred years.<br><br> Those strategic proposals built the greatest industrial power-house the world had ever seen and, after more than 200 successful years, were abandoned only during the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton (and remain abandoned to this day). Modern-day China, however, implemented most of Hamilton&#x2019;s plan and has brought about a remarkable transformation of its nation in a single generation.<br><br> Hamilton&#x2019;s 11-point plan for &#x201c;American manufactures&#x201d; is a primary inspiration for this book (see sidebar). It was part of a larger work titled Alexander Hamilton&#x2019;s Report on the Subject of Manufactures: Made in His Capacity of Secretary of the Treasury.<br><br> Alexander Hamilton&#x2019;s 11-point Plan for &#x201c;American Manufactures&#x201d;<br><br> A full view having now been taken of the inducements to the promotion of manufactures in the United States, accompanied with an examination of the principal objections which are commonly urged in opposition, it is proper, in the next place, to consider the means by which it may be effected....<br><br> In order to a better judgment of the means proper to be resorted to by the United States, it will be of use to advert to those which have been employed with success in other countries. The principal of these are&#x2014;<br><br> I. Protecting duties [import taxes, now called &#x201c;tariffs&#x201d;]&#x2014;or duties on those foreign articles which are the rivals of the domestic ones intended to be encouraged.<br><br> Duties of this nature evidently amount to a virtual bounty on the domestic fabrics, since by enhancing the charges on foreign articles, they enable the national manufacturers to undersell all their foreign competitors....[I]t has the additional recommendation of being a resource of revenue. Indeed, all the duties imposed on imported articles, though with an exclusive view to revenue, have the effect in contemplation; and, except where they fill on raw materials, wear a beneficent aspect towards the manufacturers of the country.<br><br> II. Prohibitions of rival articles, or duties equivalent to prohibitions.<br><br> This is another and an efficacious mean of encouraging national manufactures;...Of duties equivalent to prohibitions, there are examples in the laws of the United States...but they are not numerous....[I]t might almost be said, by the principles of distributive justice; certainly by the duty of endeavoring to secure to their own citizens a reciprocity of advantages.<br><br> III. Prohibitions of the exportation of the materials of manufactures.<br><br> The desire of securing a cheap and plentiful supply for the national workmen, and, where the article is either peculiar to the country, or of peculiar quality there, the jealousy of enabling foreign workmen to rival those of the nation with its own materials, are the leading motives to this species of regulation....It is seen at once, that its immediate operation is to abridge the demand and keep down the price of the produce of some other branch of industry, generally speaking, of agriculture, to the prejudice of those who carry it on; and though if it be really essential to the prosperity of any very important national manufacture, it may happen that those who are injured in the first instance, may be eventually indemnified, by the superior steadiness of an extensive domestic market depending on that prosperity: yet in a matter, in which there is so much room for nice and difficult combinations, in which such opposite considerations combat each other, prudence seems to dictate, that the expedient in question ought to be indulged with a sparing hand.<br><br> IV. Pecuniary bounties.<br><br> This has been found one of the most efficacious means of encouraging manufactures, and it is in some views the best; though it has not yet been practised upon by the government of the United States, (unless the allowance on the exportion of dried and pickled fish and salted meat, could be considered as a bounty,) and though it is less favoured by public opinion than some other modes, its advantages are these&#x2014;<br><br> 1. It is a species of encouragement more positive and direct than any other, and for that very reason, has a more immediate tendency to stimulate and uphold new enterprises, increasing the chances of profit, and diminishing the risks of loss, in the first attempts.<br><br> 2. It avoids the inconvenience of a temporary augmentation of price, which is incident to some other modes, or it produces it to a less degree; either by making no addition to the charges on the rival foreign article, as in the case of protecting duties, or by making a smaller addition. The first happens when the fund for the bounty is derived from a different object (which may or may not increase the price of some other article, according to the nature of that object); the second when the fund is derived from the same or a similar object of foreign manufacture. One per cent duty on the foreign article converted into a bounty on the domestic, will have an equal effect with a duty of two per cent exclusive of such bounty; and the price of the foreign commodity is liable to be raised, in the one case, in the proportion of one per cent; in the other, in that of two per cent. Indeed, the bounty, when drawn from another source, is calculated to promote a reduction of price; because, without laying any new charge on the foreign article, it serves to introduce a competition with it, and to increase the total quantity of the article in the market.<br><br> 3. Bounties have not, like high protecting duties, a tendency to produce scarcity....<br><br> 4. Bounties are sometimes not only the best, but the only proper expedient, for uniting the encouragement of a new object....<br><br> The true way to conciliate these two interests, is to lay a duty on foreign manufactures, of the material, the growth of which is desired to be encouraged, and to apply the produce of that duty by way of bounty, either upon the production of the material itself, or upon its manufacture at home, or upon both....<br><br> [P]ecuniary bounties are in most cases indispensable to the introduction of a new branch....Bounties are especially essential, in regard to articles, upon which those foreigners who have been accustomed to supply a country, are in the practice of granting them.<br><br> The continuance of bounties on manufactures long established, must almost always be of questionable policy; because a presumption would arise in every such case, that there were natural and inherent impediments to success But in new undertakings, they are as justifiable, as they are oftentimes necessary....<br><br> V. Premiums.<br><br> These are of a nature allied to bounties, though distinguishable from them in some important features.<br><br> Bounties are applicable to the whole quantity of an article produced or manufactured, or exported, and involve a correspondent expense&#x2014;Premiums serve to reward some particular excellence or superiority, some extraordinary exertion or skill, and are dispensed only in a small number of cases. But their effect is to stimulate general effort....<br><br> VI. The exemption of the [raw] materials of manufactures from duty.<br><br> The policy of that exemption, as a general rule, particularly in reference to new establishments, is obvious....Of a nature, bearing some affinity to that policy, is the regulation which exempts from duty the tools and implements, as well as the books, clothes, and household furniture of foreign artists, who come to reside in the United States; an advantage already secured to them by the laws of the Union, and which it is, in every view, proper to continue.<br><br> VII. Drawbacks of the duties which are imposed on the materials of manufactures....<br><br> [S]uch drawbacks are familiar in countries which systematically pursue the business of manufactures; which furnishes an argument for the observance of a similar policy in the United States; and the idea has been adopted by the laws of the Union, in the instances of salt and molasses. It is believed that it will be found advantageous to extend it to some other articles.<br><br> VIII. The encouragement of new inventions and discoveries, at home, and of the introduction into the United States of such as may have been made in other countries; particularly, those which relate to machinery.<br><br> This is among the most useful and unexceptionable of the aids which can be given to manufactures. The usual means of that encouragement are pecuniary rewards, and, for a time, exclusive privileges. The first must be employed, according to the occasion, and the utility of the invention, or discovery. For the last, so far as respects &#x201c;authors and inventors,&#x201d; provision has been made by law....<br><br> It is customary with manufacturing nations to prohibit, under severe penalties, the exportation of implements and machines, which they have either invented or improved....As far as prohibitions tend to prevent foreign competitors from deriving the benefit of the improvements made at home, they tend to increase the advantages of those by whom they may have been introduced; and operate as an encouragement to exertion.<br><br> IX. Judicious regulations for the inspection of manufactured commodities.<br><br> This is not among the least important of the means by which the prosperity of manufactures may be promoted. It is, indeed, in many cases one of the most essential. Contributing to prevent frauds upon consumers at home, and exporters to foreign countries&#x2014;to improve the quality and preserve the character of the national manufactures...<br><br> X. The facilitating of pecuniary remittances from place to place&#x2014;<br><br> Is a point of considerable moment to trade in general, and to manufactures in particular; by rendering more easy the purchase of raw materials and provisions, and the payment for manufactured supplies. A general circulation of bank paper, which is to be expected from the institution lately established, will be a most valuable mean to this end.<br><br> XI. The facilitating of the transportation of commodities.<br><br> Improvements favouring this object intimately concern all the domestic interests of a community; but they may without impropriety be mentioned as having an important relation to manufactures. There is perhaps scarcely any thing, which has been better calculated to assist the manufacturers of Great Britain, than the meliorations of the public roads of that kingdom, and the great progress which has been of late made in opening canals. Of the former, the United States stand much in need...<br><br> These examples, it is to be hoped, will stimulate the exertions of the government and citizens of every state. There can certainly be no object, more worthy of the cares of the local administrations; and it were to be wished, that there was no doubt of the power of the national government to lend its direct aid, on a comprehensive plan. This is one of those improvements, which could be prosecuted with more efficacy by the whole, than by any part or parts of the Union....<br><br> The following remarks are sufficiently judicious and pertinent to deserve a literal quotation: &#x201c;Good roads, canals, and navigable rivers, by diminishing the expense of carriage, put the remote parts of a country more nearly upon a level with those in the neighborhood of a town. They are upon that account, the greatest of all improvements.&#x201d;...<br><br> It may confidently be affirmed, that there is scarcely any thing, which has been devised, better calculated to excite a general spirit of improvement, than the institutions of this nature. They are truly invaluable.<br><br> In countries where there is great private wealth, much may be effected by the voluntary contributions of patriotic individuals; but in a community situated like that of the United States, the public purse must supply th...</p><h2>Stephen Biesty&#39;s Ancient World</h2><p>The Ancient World is the perfect subject for Stephen Biesty's illustrations - beautifully constructed, technologically advanced, and teeming with life.

Deployed at presidential discretion, they can be used in regular war zones or to kill people in such countries as Yemen and Somalia, where the United States is not officially at war. Advocates say that drones are more precise than conventional bombers, allowing warfare with minimal civilian deaths while keeping American pilots out of harm's way. Critics say that drones are cowardly and that they often kill innocent civilians while terrorizing entire villages on the ground. In this book, Hugh Gusterson explores the significance of drone warfare from multiple perspectives, drawing on accounts by drone operators, victims of drone attacks, anti-drone activists, human rights activists, international lawyers, journalists, military thinkers, and academic experts.</p><p>Gusterson examines the way drone warfare has created commuter warriors and redefined the space of the battlefield. He looks at the paradoxical mix of closeness and distance involved in remote killing: is it easier than killing someone on the physical battlefield if you have to watch onscreen? He suggests a new way of understanding the debate over civilian casualties of drone attacks. He maps "ethical slippage" over time in the Obama administration's targeting practices. And he contrasts Obama administration officials' legal justification of drone attacks with arguments by international lawyers and NGOs.</p></p><p>Hugh Gusterson is Professor of Anthropology and International Affairs at George Washington University. He is the author of <i>Nuclear Rites</i> and <i>People of the Bomb: Portraits of America's Nuclear Complex</i>.<p>Gusterson makes it clear why we don't speak clearly about drones.

No relevant piece of evidence has escaped his attention, but he uses his sources economically to extract the most telling details. He concludes with a choice of dystopian (his word) and utopian (mine) drone futures that would convince me to bet&#x2015;however reluctantly&#x2015;on the former.

We must cast our lot with the natural rather than the supernatural. Many Westerners with spiritual (but not religious) inclinations are attracted to Buddhism&#x2015;almost as a kind of moral-mental hygiene. But, as Owen Flanagan points out in <i>The Bodhisattva's Brain</i>, Buddhism is hardly naturalistic. In <i>The Bodhisattva's Brain</i>, Flanagan argues that it is possible to discover in Buddhism a rich, empirically responsible philosophy that could point us to one path of human flourishing. </p><p>Some claim that neuroscience is in the process of validating Buddhism empirically, but Flanagan's naturalized Buddhism does not reduce itself to a brain scan showing happiness patterns. "Buddhism naturalized," as Flanagan constructs it, offers instead a fully naturalistic and comprehensive philosophy, compatible with the rest of knowledge&#x2015;a way of conceiving of the human predicament, of thinking about meaning for finite material beings living in a material world.</p></p><p>Owen Flanagan is James B.

This revolutionary book about our future is based on the simple idea that, according to the Bible, heaven is not our eternal home--the New Earth is. As Jesus says in the gospel of Matthew, the next chapter of our story begins with &#34;the renewal of all things,&#34; by which he means the earth we love in all its beauty, our own selves, and the things that make for a rich life: music, art, food, laughter and all that we hold dear. Everything shall be renewed &#34;when the world is made new.&#34; More than anything else, how you envision your future shapes your current experience. If you knew that God was going to restore your life and everything you love any day; if you believed a great and glorious goodness was coming to you--not in a vague heaven but right here on this earth--you would have a hope to see you through anything, an anchor for your soul, &#34;an unbreakable spiritual lifeline, reaching past all appearances right to the very presence of God&#34; (Hebrews 6:19). Most Christians (most people for that matter) fail to look forward to their future because their view of heaven is vague, religious, and frankly boring. Hope begins when we understand that for the believer nothing is lost. Heaven is not a life in the clouds; it is not endless harp-strumming or worship-singing. Rather, the life we long for, the paradise Adam and Eve knew, is precisely the life that is coming to us. And that life is coming soon.</p><p>John Eldredge is the author of numerous bestselling books including Wild at Heart, Fathered by God, and Beautiful Outlaw. He is also director of Ransomed Heart, a ministry devoted to restoring men and women in the love of God. John and Stasi live in Colorado.</p><h2>Criminal Investigation</h2><p>A crime has occurred.

And there are more, all seasoned by a time of tragedy and triumph.<br><br>To this generation who gave so much and asked so little, Brokaw offers eloquent tribute in true stories of everyday heroes in extraordinary times.</p><p>Veteran reporter and <i>NBC Nightly News</i> anchor Tom Brokaw went to France to make a documentary marking the 40th anniversary of D-day in 1984. Although he was thoroughly briefed on the historical background of the invasion, he was totally unprepared for how it would affect him emotionally. Flooded with childhood memories of World War II, Brokaw began asking veterans at the ceremony to revisit their past and talk about what happened, triggering a chain reaction of war-torn confessions and Brokaw's compulsion to capture their experiences in what he terms "the permanence a book would represent."<p> After almost 15 years and hundreds of letters and interviews, Brokaw wrote <i>The Greatest Generation</i>, a representative cross-section of the stories he came across. However, this collection is more than a mere chronicle of a tumultuous time, it's history made personal by a cast of everyday people transformed by extraordinary circumstances: the first women to break the homemaker mold, minorities suffering countless indignities to boldly fight for their country, infantrymen who went on to become some of the most distinguished leaders in the world, small-town kids who became corporate magnates. From the reminiscences of George Bush and Julia Child to the astonishing heroism and moving love stories of everyday people, <i>The Greatest Generation</i> salutes those whose sacrifices changed the course of American history. <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p>"A moving scrapbook...a tribute to the members of the World War II generation to whom we Americans and the world owe so much." <br>-- <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Full of wonderful, wrenching tales of a generation of heroes.

He was one of Britain's most important poets, his work infused with myth; a love of nature, conservation, and ecology; of fishing and beasts in brooding landscapes.</p><p>With an equal gift for poetry and prose, and with a soul as capacious as any poet in history, he was also a prolific children's writer and has been hailed as the greatest English letter-writer since John Keats. His magnetic personality and insatiable appetite for friendship, love, and life also attracted more scandal than any poet since Lord Byron. His lifelong quest to come to terms with the suicide of his first wife, Sylvia Plath, is the saddest and most infamous moment in the public history of modern poetry.</p><p>Hughes left behind a more complete archive of notes and journals than any other major poet, including thousands of pages of drafts, unpublished poems, and memorandum books that make up an almost complete record of Hughes's inner life, which he preserved for posterity. Renowned scholar Jonathan Bate has spent five years in the Hughes archives, unearthing a wealth of new material. His book offers, for the first time, the full story of Hughes's life as it was lived, remembered, and reshaped in his art. It is a book that honors, though not uncritically, Hughes's poetry and the art of life-writing, approached by his biographer with an honesty answerable to Hughes's own.</p></p><p><p>Jonathan Bate is a biographer, critic, and broadcaster. His many books include <em>The Genius of Shakespeare</em>, described by Sir Peter Hall as "the best modern book on Shakespeare"; a biography of the poet John Clare, which won Britain's two oldest literary awards, the Hawthornden Prize and the James Tait Black Prize; <em>Soul of the Age</em>, an intellectual life of Shakespeare, which was runner-up for the Biography Prize of PEN America; and <em>The Song of the Earth</em>, a pioneering book on poetry and the environment. He is also the author of a novel, <em>The Cure for Love</em>, and the hit one-man play for Simon Callow, <em>Being Shakespeare</em>. A fellow of both the British Academy and the Royal Society of Literature, he is provost of Worcester College and professor of English literature at Oxford University. Married to the author Paula Byrne, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to higher education and was knighted in 2015 for his services to literary scholarship.</p>&#x201c;Bate has written, capaciously, arrestingly, a kind of tragedy...often veers close to the poet&#x2019;s singular perspective...He reminds us Ted Hughes was a marvelous poet: firstly, then fitfully, and then in a blaze near the end, and that the greatness in the work draws power from sources deeper than myth.&#x201d; (<b>Glyn Maxwell, New York Times Book Review</b>)<br><br>&#x201c;Magisterially respectful of Hughes...An uncompromising biographer [who] hasn&#x2019;t been swayed by interested parties...In Hughes&#x2019;s life, with its echoes of Greek tragedy, Bate finds grist for a new perspective on his work.&#x201d; (<b>Christopher Benfey, The Atlantic</b>)<br><br>&#x201c;An incisive, humane and deeply absorbing account of Hughes&#x2019;s life and work.&#x201d; (<b>New York Times</b>)<br><br>&#x201c;Remarkable...one of the very best biographies in years.&#x201d; (<b>Joyce Carol Oates</b>)<br><br>&#x201c;A masterly biography.&#x201d; (<b>San Francisco Chronicle</b>)<br><br>&#x201c;Jonathan Bate is a dazzling scholar, and in TED HUGHES he sheds new light on the poet and his times...Mr. Bate embodies...the touchstone of good biography: the complete sympathy of complete detachment.&#x201d; (<b>Sara Wheeler, in "The Best Biographies of 2015," Wall Street Journal</b>)<br><br>&#x201c;A vigorous biography... Bate, a professor of literature, gives sustained attention to Hughes&#x2019;s poems, substantiating the poet&#x2019;s own view that &#x201c;as an imaginative writer, my only capital is my own life.&#x201d; (<b>The New Yorker</b>)<br><br>&#x201c;An excellent biography: compulsively readable, elegantly assembled... and sensitive to the many aspects of Hughes&#x2019;s grand and complicated character.&#x201d; (<b>Christopher Wiman, Wall Street Journal, front page review</b>)<br><br>&#x201c;An intelligent, even donnish work of criticism that connects the poems to the life...&#x201d; (<b>Washington Post</b>)<br><br>&#x201c;...Bate has provided new depth to Ted Hughes&#x2019; biography...&#x201d; (<b>Minneapolis Star Tribune</b>)</p><h2>Bound by Recognition</h2><p><p>In an era of heightened concern about injustice in relations of identity and difference, political theorists often prescribe equal recognition as a remedy for the ills of subordination. Drawing on the philosophy of Hegel, they envision a system of reciprocal knowledge and esteem, in which the affirming glance of others lets everyone be who they really are. This book challenges the equation of recognition with justice. Patchen Markell mines neglected strands of the concept's genealogy and reconstructs an unorthodox interpretation of Hegel, who, in the unexpected company of Sophocles, Aristotle, Arendt, and others, reveals why recognition's promised satisfactions are bound to disappoint, and even to stifle.</p><br><p> Written with exceptional clarity, the book develops an alternative account of the nature and sources of identity-based injustice in which the pursuit of recognition is part of the problem rather than the solution. And it articulates an alternative conception of justice rooted not in the recognition of identity of the other but in the acknowledgment of our own finitude in the face of a future thick with surprise. Moving deftly among contemporary political philosophers (including Taylor and Kymlicka), the close interpretation of ancient and modern texts (Hegel's <i>Phenomenology</i>, Aristotle's <i>Poetics</i>, and more), and the exploration of rich case studies drawn from literature (<i>Antigone</i>), history (Jewish emancipation in nineteenth-century Prussia), and modern politics (official multiculturalism), Bound by Recognition is at once a sustained treatment of the problem of recognition and a sequence of virtuoso studies.</p></p><p><p>"This is a remarkably sophisticated, learned, and elegant piece of work, and an important contribution to debates about political identity, the role and shape of 'recognition,' and citizenship. The arguments are ingenious and masterfully pursued."<b>--Dana Villa, author of <i>Socratic Citizenship</i></b></p><p>"<i>Bound by Recognition</i> is an important and original contribution to the literature on struggles over recognition. Markell's thesis is that these struggles should not be oriented towards the definitive mutual recognition of the contending partners, for this ideal is unobtainable and dangerous in practice. Rather, they should be seen as human, all too human intersubjective activities of imperfect acknowledgement in conditions of finitude, plurality, and the contingency of identities. This Arendtian thesis is grounded in brilliant and provocative interpretations of Sophocles, Aristotle, Hegel, Marx, Taylor, and Kymlicka."<b>--James Tully, University of Toronto, author of <i>Strange Multiplicity</i></b></p><b>Patchen Markell</b> is Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago.</p><h2>Miss Marple&#39;s Final Cases</h2><p>Volume 78 in The Agatha Christie Classic Collection (1979). Limited edition of 1000 copies worldwide First, the mystery man in the church with a bullet-wound...then, the riddle of a dead man&#39;s buried treasure...the curious conduct oif a caretaker after a fatal riding accident...the corpse and a tape-measure...the girl framed for theft...and the suspect accused of stabbing his wife with a dagger. Six gripping cases with one thing in common -- the astonishing deductive powers of Miss Marple. Also includes two non-Marple mysteries, &#39;The Dressmaker&#39;s Doll&#39; and &#39;In a Glass Darkly&#39;.</p><p>Agatha Christie was born in Torquay in 1890 and became, quite simply, the best-selling novelist in history. Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, written towards the end of the First World War, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, who was to become the most popular detective in crime fiction since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in over 100 foreign languages. She is the author of 80 crime novels and short story collections, 19 plays, and six novels under the name of Mary Westmacott&#39;When it all becomes clear as day, the reader can only say, &#34;Now why didn&#39;t I think of that?&#34; But he never does. Miss Christie at her best.&#39; Springfield Republican</p><h2>Reason and Morality</h2><p><p>"Most modern philosophers attempt to solve the problem of morality from within the epistemological assumptions that define the dominant cultural perspective of our age. Alan Gewirth's <i>Reason and Morality</i> is a major work in this ongoing enterprise. Gewirth develops, with patience and skill, what he calls a 'modified naturalism' in which morality is derived by logic alone from the concept of action. . . . I think that the publication of <i>Reason and Morality</i> is a major event in the history of moral philosophy. It develops with great power a new and exciting position in ethical naturalism. No one, regardless of philosophical stance, can read this work without an enlargement of mind. It illuminates morality and agency for all."&#x2014;E. M. Adams, <i>The Review of Metaphysics</i><br> <br> "This is a fascinating study of an apparently intractable problem. Gewirth has provided plenty of material for further discussion, and his theory deserves serious consideration. He is always aware of possible rejoinders and argues in a rigorous manner, showing a firm grasp of the current state of moral and political philosophy."&#x2014;<i>Mind</i></p></p><p>Gewirth&#39;s system synthesizes many of the traditional issues of political philosophy, including rights and duties, obligation and dissent, the nature of the state and of voluntary associations, punishment, and welfare policy.</p><h2>Encyclopedia of Natural Healing</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

Few words strike such fear in the minds of travelers. In cities around the world, lurking beneath the plush blankets of otherwise pristine-looking hotel beds are tiny bloodthirsty beasts just waiting for weary wanderers to surrender to a vulnerable slumber. Though bed bugs today have infested the globe, the common bed bug is not a new pest at all. Indeed, as Brooke Borel reveals in this unusual history, this most-reviled species may date back over 250,000 years, wreaking havoc on our collective psyche while even inspiring art, literature, and music&#x2014;in addition to vexatious red welts.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Infested, </i>Borel introduces readers to the biological and cultural histories of these amazingly adaptive insects, and the myriad ways in which humans have responded to them. She travels to meet with scientists who are rearing bed bug colonies&#x2014;even by feeding them with their own blood (ouch!)&#x2014;and to the stages of musicals performed in honor of the pests. She explores the history of bed bugs and their apparent disappearance in the 1950s after the introduction of DDT, charting how current infestations have flourished in direct response to human chemical use as well as the ease of global travel. She also introduces us to the economics of bed bug infestations, from hotels to homes to office buildings, and the expansive industry that has arisen to combat them.<br><br> Hiding during the day in the nooks and seams of mattresses, box springs, bed frames, headboards, dresser tables, wallpaper, or any clutter around a bed, bed bugs are thriving and eager for their next victim. By providing fascinating details on bed bug science and behavior as well as a captivating look into the lives of those devoted to researching or eradicating them, <i>Infested</i> is sure to inspire at least a nibble of respect for these tenacious creatures&#x2014;while also ensuring that you will peek beneath the sheets with prickly apprehension.</p><p><b>Brooke Borel</b> is a science writer and journalist. She is a contributing editor to <i>Popular Science</i>, and her writing has also appeared in such places as the <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>Slate</i>.&#x201c;A book about bedbugs is, by necessity, a book about nearly everything: about travel and adventure, about our �relationship to nature, about how scientists solve problems, about trust and whether we view strangers as friends or foes. It is a book about what people will do under extreme circumstances, and about environmental politics, and art and mental illness. It is even a book about kinky sex. Borel deftly takes us through this arthropod microcosm of the universe, as she traces the culture and biology of a resurgent scourge.&#x201d; (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Our encounters with bed bugs used to be limited to wishes for a good night&#x2019;s sleep. But now they&#x2019;re everywhere&#x2014;in hotels, apartments, and even subways.

Motivated partly by a desire to understand the bedbug infestations she'd suffered, Borel, a science writer, began interviewing entomologists about the tiny bloodsuckers in 2010 and has been researching them ever since.&#x201d; (<i>Chicago Reader</i>)<br><br>In an odyssey that begins with understandable loathing and ends with surprising sympathy, Borel takes us on a smart, subtle, witty journey through the biology and history of the bed bug&#x2014;an insect that has been our companion for hundreds of millennia, yet one that we barely understand and have no clue how to control. Borel captures the persistence of the bug, the obsessiveness of its foes, and the eagerness of entrepreneurs to turn a quick profit with no thought for the long consequences. It is impossible to read <i>Infested</i> without experiencing fascination, respect&#x2014;and just maybe, a phantom itch.&#x201d; (Maryn McKenna, author of Superbug: The Fatal Menace of MRSA)<br><br>&#x201c;Borel has&nbsp;done&nbsp;the seemingly impossible: written an absolute page-turner of a book about bed bugs. <i>Infested </i>is&nbsp;as engaging as it is erudite,&nbsp;as fun as it is informative. This is popular science writing at its best.&#x201d; (Seth Mnookin, author of The Panic Virus: The True Story Behind the Vaccine-Autism Controversy)<br><br>&#x201c;A fun, wild romp through the wily world of bed bugs and the folks hunting them down. Borel travels from Brooklyn bedposts to Bohemian benches on the trail of this burgeoning pest, itching for the reader as she goes. <i>Infested</i> unveils the secrets of these frankly weird bloodsuckers, right down to their unlikely sex lives, and introduces readers to the obsessives looking to stop their march into your own bed. A terrific science book.&#x201d; (Dan Vergano, National Geographic)<br><br>&#x201c;Borel&#x2019;s captivating writing quickly draws you into the mysterious and creepy tale of the bed bug.&nbsp; Both a journey of self-discovery and an exploration into the world of this fascinating insect, Borel shows us that the story of the bed bug is ultimately intertwined with the&nbsp;history of the human species.&nbsp; You probably don't like bed bugs, but you will love this book!&#x201d; (Scott Richard Shaw, author of Planet of the Bugs: Evolution and the Rise of Insects)<br><br>&#x201c;Borel knows her stuff, but she also knows how to write; her clear and chatty prose turns what ought to be a dreary treatise into an entertaining read. She makes complicated things sound simple. She isn&#x2019;t afraid to tell the boffins when she doesn&#x2019;t get it, and make them spell it out. As well as summarizing their findings, Borel provides a colorful history of their research trips, bringing her interviewees to life.&#x201d; (<i>Spectator</i>)</p><h2>Worlds Together, Worlds Apart: A History of the World from the Beginnings of Humankind to the Present</h2><p><p><strong>True to its title, this uniquely integrated text highlights the stories and themes in world history that tied cultures and regions together, and in some cases, drove them apart.</strong></p> In this second edition, the book's non-Eurocentric approach continues with expansions of the original eleven world history "turning point" stories from the modern period to include ten more "turning point" stories from the earlier periods of world history.

But he demonstrated remarkable creativity in circumventing precedent and formulating new rules in multiple areas of the law. <i>Henry Friendly, Greatest Judge of His Era</i> describes the inner workings of Friendly&#x2019;s chambers and his craftsmanship in writing opinions. His articles on habeas corpus, the Fourth Amendment, self-incrimination, and the reach of the state are still cited by the Supreme Court. </p><p><br></p><p><br>Dorsen draws on extensive research, employing private memoranda between the judges and interviews with all fifty-one of Friendly&#x2019;s law clerks&#x2014;a veritable Who&#x2019;s Who that includes Chief Justice John R.

Here in Illinois, the numbers are equally awesome: seventeen thousand species call the state home, among them four thousand types of flies; fifteen hundred types of grasshoppers, cicadas, and aphids; five thousand types of beetles; two hundred types of ants, wasps, and bees; and two thousand types of butterflies and moths. With so much entomological diversity here in the Midwest, Illinois residents needn't look further than their own backyards to discover the rich and secret world of insects and spiders. <br><br>Marrying art and entomology, <i>Illinois Insects and Spiders</i> is a unique introduction to local biodiversity. Artist Peggy Macnamara celebrates the state's burgeoning insect and spider populations with twenty-seven color plates of beautiful renderings of numerous species, organized both taxonomically and thematically. The insects on each plate are depicted true to scale in relation to one another and are displayed approximately ten times larger than life size. Accompanying each plate are lively captions-written by Field Museum curators and collection managers-that identify the species and reveal their interesting behaviors and unique habitats.<br><br><i>Illinois Insects and Spiders</i> encourages readers to explore the biodiversity at their feet-in the shiny beetles on the ground-and in the air-in the glint of a lightning bug in summer.

Historian and librarian Robert Darnton uses his exclusive access to a trove of documents-letters and documents from authors, publishers, printers, paper millers, type founders, ink manufacturers, smugglers, wagon drivers, warehousemen, and accountants-involving a publishing house in the Swiss town of Neuchatel to bring this world to life. Like other places on the periphery of France, Switzerland was a hotbed of piracy, carefully monitoring the demand for certain kinds of books and finding ways of fulfilling it. Focusing in particular on the diary of Jean-Fran�ois Favarger, a traveling sales rep for a Swiss firm whose 1778 voyage, on horseback and on foot, around France to visit bookstores and renew accounts forms the spine of this story, Darnton reveals not only how the industry worked and which titles were in greatest demand, but the human scale of its operations.<br><br><em>A Literary Tour de France</em> is literally that. Darnton captures the hustle, picaresque comedy, and occasional risk of Favarger's travels in the service of books, and in the process offers an engaging, immersive, and unforgettable narrative of book culture at a critical moment in France's history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert Darnton </strong>is Carl H.

Lee Siegel, scholar and magician, uncovers the age-old practices of magic in sacred rites and rituals and unveils the contemporary world of Indian magic of street and stage entertainers.<br> <br> Siegel's journeys take him from ancient Sanskrit texts to the slums of New Delhi to find remnants of a remarkable magical tradition. In the squalid settlement of Shadipur, he is initiated into a band of Muslim street conjurers and performs as their shill while they tutor him in their con and craft. Siegel also becomes acquainted with Hindu theatrical magicians, who claim descent from court illusionists and now dress as maharajahs to perform a repertoire of tricks full of poignant kitsch and glitz.<br> <br> Masterfully using a panoply of narrative sleights to recreate the magical world of India, Net of Magic intersperses travelogue, history, ethnography, and fiction. Siegel's vivid, often comic tale is crowded with shills and stooges, tourists and pickpockets, snake charmers and fakirs. Among the cast of characters are Naseeb, a poor Muslim street magician who guides Siegel into the closed circle of itinerant performers; the Industrial Magician, paid by a bank, who convinces his audience to buy traveler's checks by making twenty-rupee notes disappear; the Government Magician, who does a trick with condoms to encourage family planning; P. C. Sorcar, Jr., the most celebrated Indian stage magician; and the fictive Professor M. T. Bannerji, the world's greatest magician, who assumes various guises over a millennium of Indian history and finally arrives in the conjuring capital of the world&#x2014;Las Vegas.<br> <br> Like Indra's net&#x2014;the web of illusion in which Indian performers ensnare their audience&#x2014;<i>Net of Magic</i> captures the reader in a seductive portrayal of a world where deception is celebrated and lies are transformed into compelling and universal truths.</p></p><p><b>Lee Siegel</b>&nbsp;is professor of religious studies at the University of Hawaii. He is the author of many books, including&nbsp;<i>Love in a Dead Language</i>,&nbsp;<i>Who Wrote the Book of Love?</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Love and the Incredibly Old Man</i>, all published by the University of Chicago Press.Siegel, a professor of religion at the University of Hawaii and an amateur magician, explores magic in India, a place that is for him a "cauldron of illusions." He enters the magicians' world by eating with them, performing his own tricks for them and ultimately shilling for them. The first half of the book is devoted to the wandering, low-caste Muslim street magicians. The second discusses stage magicians, descendents of royal court conjurers and seers. Siegel blends history and religious studies, fiction (in the form of short stories centered on traditional tricks in the magicians' repertoire) and travel ramble as he takes us from the slums of Delhi to Madras in the south and Kashmir in the north. For Siegel, India is a country of many nationalities where religion divides and magic is the unifying factor. Using vivid word pictures, he conveys the sights, sounds and smells of a land where truth transcends mere fact, where illusions serve as "escapes from the discomforts" of life. Siegel's ( Laughing Matters: Comic Tradition in India ) colorful narrative about our need to be deceived and the delight we take therein avoids the pitfall he finds in many books on magic--what is astonishing when seen becomes astonishingly dull in print. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>World Mythology : An Anthology of the Great Myths and Epics</h2><p><p><i>World Mythology</i> is a compilation of over 50 great myths and epics.

From Goya to Blake, from David to Delacroix, from Courbet to Cezanne, artists explored the links between perception and history, and in so doing challenged the prevailing definitions of art and the existing order of society. First published in 1994, this innovative and ground-breaking survey details the development of a critical perspective in nineteenth-century painting and sculpture. For the revised edition, a new introduction by Stephen Eisenman provides a cogent overview of the century, its issues, and its art. Three completely new chapters have been added, which discuss photography and its crucial role in nineteenth-century art; American and German landscape painting and its effect on the growth of romantic nationalism in each country; and Toulouse-Lautrec, whose popular appeal consists both in his work's novel technique and medium and in its exotic sexual perspectives. <i>Nineteenth Century Art</i> embraces many aspects of the "new" art historyattention to issues of class and gender, racism, and Eurocentrismbut it also emphasizes the remarkable vitality and subversiveness of the era's best art. Indeed, nineteenth-century artists addressed many of the aesthetic, political, and moral issues that preoccupy audiences and historians today, such as the relationship between popular and elite culture, and the representation of women and non-European peoples in Western art. This rich and diverse volume demonstrates that nineteenth-century art remains compelling today because its critical insights have rarely been surpassed. It will prove of interest not only to the specialist, but to anyone fascinated by the art, history, and culture of the era. 428 illustrations, 63 in color.</p><p>Frances K. Pohl is Professor of Art History at Pomona College, California.The political, industrial, and cultural revolutions that punctuated the 19th century were reflected in the fine arts, though not always consciously. Art was no longer the sole domain of the upper classes, and the complexity of the new social order became evident in the works of artists like Blake and Goya early in the century and Cassatt and Eakins later on. In this first comprehensive reconsideration of 19th-century art from the viewpoint of the "new" art history, Eisenman and four other art historians examine issues of class, gender, racism, and Eurocentrism as they pertain to North American and European art. This handsomely produced volume, rich in ideas and illustrations, complements the works of Albert Boime (e.g., The Art of Exclusion: Representing Blacks in the Nineteenth Century, Smithsonian, 1990). Of interest to scholars and art enthusiasts alike.<br><i>Daniel J.

But I think you'll like how you turn out."<br> --Bill Bridges, author, Transitions and Job Shift<br> <br> "Dave's book reveals a powerful and profound formula for crafting a genuinely rich life.

This period was once relegated to winding down, but now it holds the promise of our most significant and passionate years, a time when we can be ourselves and contribute. Corbett describes a "life portfolio"&#x2014;a balanced mix of work, learning, leisure, family time, and giving back that individuals tailor to their personality and goals. Using compelling stories, the book shows how to allocate one's time and energy among competing needs and personal dreams.

But Tao cannot fully be explained in words; it can only felt and experienced. Tao is something you live, day by day, moment by moment. It's the omnipresent oneness beyond ephemeral phenomena that expresses itself in everything.<br><br>New York Times bestselling author Ilchi Lee, an enlightened Tao master from South Korea, has laid out a path to living Tao everyday. Along this path, he guides you to an understanding of the meaning of birth, death, and everything in between, building a foundation for living a complete and whole life.<br><br>The universal principles contained in "Living Tao: Timeless Principles for Everyday Enlightenment" stem from the Korean practice of Sundo, an ancient tradition of mind-body training, as well as Lee's own life experience.<br><br>With these tangible principles, Ilchi Lee makes this profound topic simple and accessible. "Living Tao" has an unparalleled depth in its simplicity that anyone can absorb and immediately apply.<br><br>* 2015 INDIEFAB Book of the Year Award Winner, Bronze, Body, Mind &amp; Spirit</p><p>ILCHI LEE has authored 37 books including the New York Times bestseller, The Call of Sedona: Journey of the Heart, as well as Change: Realizing Your Greatest Potential and Brain Wave Vibration: Getting Back into the Rhythm of a Happy, Healthy Life. He is a dedicated humanitarian who founded the International Brain Education Association and works with the United Nations and other organizations for a peaceful, sustainable world. He also founded the University of Brain Education, the Global Cyber University, and the natural healing practices of Dahn Yoga and Brain Education.Due to the influence of Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching, many people think that the Tao belongs to China. However, in most ancient East Asian countries, the Tao was an important cultural, spiritual tradition, and a part of life. Although it's clear that the word, Tao, is from an Eastern language, in fact, the Tao does not belong to the East alone. Even before the word existed, the Tao is that something that has always existed fully, transcending the limitations of space and time comprehensible to humans. <br><br>I have little interest in understanding the Tao on a conceptual and intellectual level. For the Tao is not to be found in words. My interest is in how to feel and become one with the Tao. We must guard against the Tao remaining as no more than a superficial idea, as a spiritual accessory, failing to become a part of our lives.<br><br>The purpose of this book is not to provide an emergency prescription or cure-all to solve an in an instant all of your problems. The purpose of this book is to methodically teach you a path to the Tao through 12 steps, each of which is a chapter, and to inspire you with a passion for living a life of oneness with the Tao.<br><br>The path to Tao introduced in this book is rooted in my personal experience and in Sundo, which is Korea's own millennia-old tradition of mind-body training. This Sundo existed before Taoism and Buddhism were prevalent, and, although it influenced and was influenced by other religions and spiritual traditions, it developed very independently. <br><br>The core philosophy of Sundo is found in complete oneness with the Tao, and this is expressed as follows in the Chun Bu Kyung, which is an ancient Korean scripture. . . .<br><br>As the Chun Bu Kyung says, all humans have an inner longing to know the Tao. Human bodies also contain a complete Tao sense and system through which they can feel and see the Tao. You can gradually grow closer to the Tao by ceaselessly awakening that sense and working to live a Tao-centered life.</p><h2>Fire Service Pump Operator: Principles And Practice</h2><p>Achieve the professional qualifications needed to become an apparatus driver and pump operator with Fire Service Pump Operator: Principles and Practice.

For more than 40 years he has been creating massive structures that guide and coerce the space around them, operating on equal terms with their environments instead of vanishing into them. But alongside these sculptures he has produced a large body of drawings whose specific material qualities and processual execution on flat surfaces suggest a material density and a physical presence comparable to sculpture. Serra sees drawing as one of the few activities in which he can comprehend the sources of his work-it allows him to "grasp the world." The exhibition <i>Drawings-Work Comes Out of Work</i> presents six groups of works from the last 10 years in large-format illustrations and includes tantalizing photographic glimpses of the artist at work in his studio. Art historian James Lawrence contributes an essay on this hitherto under-published aspect of Serra's oeuvre.</p><p></p><h2>Collection Management Basics (Library and Information Science Text Series)</h2><p><p>Now thoroughly revised for today's 21st-century library environment, this title provides a complete update of the classic <i>Developing Library and Information Center Collections</i>&#x2015;the standard text and authority on collection development for all types of libraries and library school students since 1979.</p></p><p><p>The heart of every library is its collection.

It is the best and most successful guide to reading comprehension for the general reader. And now it has been completely rewritten and updated. You are told about the various levels of reading and how to achieve them -- from elementary reading, through systematic skimming and inspectional reading, to speed reading, you learn how to pigeonhole a book, X-ray it, extract the author&#39;s message, criticize. You are taught the different reading techniques for reading practical books, imaginative literature, plays, poetry, history, science and mathematics, philosophy and social science. Finally, the authors offer a recommended reading list and supply reading tests whereby you can measure your own progress in reading skills, comprehension and speed.</p><p>Dr. Mortimer J.

Particularly, it is for readers of books. Even more particularly, it is for those whose main purpose in reading books is to gain increased understanding.<br><br>By "readers" we mean people who are still accustomed, as almost every literate and intelligent person used to be, to gain a large share of their information about and their understanding of the world from the written word. Not all of it, of course; even in the days before radio and television, a certain amount of information and understanding was acquired through spoken words and through observation. But for intelligent and curious people that was never enough. They knew that they had to read too, and they did read.<br><br>There is some feeling nowadays that reading is not as necessary as it once was. Radio and especially television have taken over many of the functions once served by print, just as photography has taken over functions once served by painting and other graphic arts. Admittedly, television serves some of these functions extremely well; the visual communication of news events, for example, has enormous impact. The ability of radio to give us information while we are engaged in doing other things -- for instance, driving a caris remarkable, and a great saving of time. But it may be seriously questioned whether the advent of modern communications media has much enhanced our understanding of the world in which we live.<br><br>Perhaps we know more about the world than we used to, and insofar as knowledge is prerequisite to understanding, that is all to the good. But knowledge is not as much a prerequisite to understanding as is commonly supposed. We do not have to <i>know</i> everything about something in order to <i>understand</i> it; too many facts are often as much of an obstacle to understanding as too few. There is a sense in which we moderns are inundated with facts to the detriment of understanding.<br><br>One of the reasons for this situation is that the very media we have mentioned are so designed as to make thinking seem unnecessary (though this is only an appearance). The packaging of intellectual positions and views is one of the most active enterprises of some of the best minds of our day. The viewer of television, the listener to radio, the reader of magazines, is presented with a whole complex of elements -- all the way from ingenious rhetoric to carefully selected data and statistics -- to make it easy for him to "make up his own mind" with the minimum of difficulty and effort. But the packaging is often done so effectively that the viewer, listener, or reader does not make up his own mind at all. Instead, he inserts a packaged opinion into his mind, somewhat like inserting a cassette into a cassette player. He then pushes a button and "plays back" the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so. He has performed acceptably without having had to think.<br><br>Active Reading<br><br>As we said at the beginning, we will be principally concerned in these pages with the development of skill in reading books; but the rules of reading that, if followed and practiced, develop such skill can be applied also to printed material in general, to any type of reading matter -- to newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, articles, tracts, even advertisements.<br><br>Since reading of any sort is an activity, all reading must to some degree be active. Completely passive reading is impossible; we cannot read with our eyes immobilized and our minds asleep. Hence when we contrast active with passive reading, our purpose is, first, to call attention to the fact that reading can be <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> active, and second, to point out that the <i>more active</i> the reading the <i>better.</i> One reader is better than another in proportion as he is capable of a greater range of activity in reading and exerts more effort. He is better if he demands more of himself and of the text before him.<br><br>Though, strictly speaking, there can be no absolutely passive reading, many people think that, as compared with writing and speaking, which are obviously active undertakings, reading and listening are entirely passive. The writer or speaker must put out some effort, but no work need be done by the reader or listener. Reading and listening are thought of as <i>receiving</i> communication from someone who is actively engaged in <i>giving</i> or <i>sending</i> it. The mistake here is to suppose that receiving communication is like receiving a blow or a legacy or a judgment from the court. On the contrary, the reader or listener is much more like the catcher in a game of baseball.<br><br>Catching the ball is just as much an activity as pitching or hitting it. The pitcher or batter is the <i>sender</i> in the sense that his activity initiates the motion of the ball. The catcher or fielder is the <i>receiver</i> in the sense that his activity terminates it. Both are active, though the activities are different. If anything is passive, it is the ball. It is the inert thing that is put in motion or stopped, whereas the players are active, moving to pitch, hit, or catch. The analogy with writing and reading is almost perfect. The thing that is written and read, like the ball, is the passive object common to the two activities that begin and terminate the process.<br><br>We can take this analogy a step further. The art of catching is the skill of catching every kind of pitch -- fast bails and curves, changeups and knucklers. Similarly, the art of reading is the skill of catching every sort of communication as well as possible.<br><br>It is noteworthy that the pitcher and catcher are successful only to the extent that they cooperate. The relation of writer and reader is similar. The writer isn't trying <i>not</i> to be caught, although it sometimes seems so. Successful communication occurs in any case where what the writer wanted to have received finds its way into the reader's possession. The writer's skill and the reader's skill converge upon a common end.<br><br>Admittedly, writers vary, just as pitchers do. Some writers have excellent "control"; they know exactly what they want to convey, and they convey it precisely and accurately. Other things being equal, they are easier to "catch" than a "wild" writer without "control."<br><br>There is one respect in which the analogy breaks down. The ball is a simple unit. It is either <i>completely</i> caught or not. A piece of writing, however, is a complex object. It can be received more or less completely, all the way from very little of what the writer intended to the whole of it. The amount the reader "catches" will usually depend on the amount of activity he puts into the process, as well as upon the skill with which he executes the different mental acts involved.<br><br>What does active reading entail? We will return to this question many times in this book. For the moment, it suffices to say that, given the same thing to read, one person reads it better than another, first, by reading it more actively, and second, by performing each of the acts involved more skillfully. These two things are related. Reading is a complex activity, just as writing is. It consists of a large number of separate acts, all of which must be performed in a good reading. The person who can perform more of them is better able to read.<br><br>&gt;<br>The Goals of Reading:<br><br>Reading for Information and Reading for Understanding<br><br>You have a mind. Now let us suppose that you also have a book that you want to read. The book consists of language written by someone for the sake of communicating something to you. Your success in reading it is determined by the extent to which you receive everything the writer intended to communicate.<br><br>That, of course, is too simple. The reason is that there are two possible relations between your mind and the book, not just one. These two relations are exemplified by two different experiences that you can have in reading your book.<br><br>There is the book; and here is your mind. As you go through the pages, either you understand perfectly everything the author has to say or you do not. If you do, you may have gained information, but you could not have increased your understanding. If the book is completely intelligible to you from start to finish, then the author and you are as two minds in the same mold. The symbols on the page merely express the common understanding you had before you met.<br><br>Let us take our second alternative. You do not understand the book perfectly. Let us even assume -- what unhappily is not always true -- that you understand enough to know that you do not understand it all. You know the book has more to say than you understand and hence that it contains something that can increase your understanding.<br><br>What do you do then? You can take the book to someone else who, you think, can read better than you, and have him explain the parts that trouble you. ("He" may be a living person or another book -- a commentary or textbook. ) Or you may decide that what is over your head is not worth bothering about, that you understand enough. In either case, you are not doing the job of reading that the book requires.<br><br>That is done in only one way. Without external help of any sort, you go to work on the book. With nothing but the power of your own mind, you operate on the symbols before you in such a way that you gradually lift yourself from <i>a state of understanding less to one of understanding more.</i> Such elevation, accomplished by the mind working on a book, is highly skilled reading, the kind of reading that a book which challenges your understanding deserves.<br><br>Thus we can roughly define what we mean by the art of reading as follows: the process whereby a mind, with nothing to operate on but the symbols of the readable matter, and with no help from outside, elevates itself by the power of its own operations. The mind passes from understanding less to understanding more. The skilled operations that cause this to happen are the various acts that constitute the art of reading.<br><br>To pass from understanding less to understanding more by your own intellectual effort in reading is something like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. It certainly feels that way. It is a major exertion. Obviously, it is a more active kind of reading than you have done before, entailing not only more varied activity but also much more skill in the performance of the various acts required. Obviously, too, the things that are usually regarded as more difficult to read, and hence as only for the better reader, are those that are more likely to deserve and demand this kind of reading.<br><br>The distinction between reading for information and reading for understanding is deeper than this. Let us try to say more about it. We will have to consider both goals of reading because the line between what is readable in one way and what must be read in the other is often hazy. To the extent that we can keep these two goals of reading distinct, we can employ the word "reading" in two distinct senses.<br><br>The first sense is the one in which we speak of ourselves as reading newspapers, magazines, or anything else that, according to our skill and talents, is at once thoroughly intelligible to us. Such things may increase our store of information, but they cannot improve our understanding, for our understanding was equal to them before we started. Otherwise, we would have felt the shock of puzzlement and perplexity that comes from getting in over our depth - that is, if we were both alert and honest.<br><br>The second sense is the one in which a person tries to read something that at first he does not completely understand. Here the thing to be read is initially better or higher than the reader. The writer is communicating something that can increase the reader's understanding. Such communication between unequals must be possible, or else one person could never learn from another, either through speech or writing. Here by "learning" is meant understanding more, not remembering more information that has the same degree of intelligibility as other information you already possess.<br><br>There is clearly no difficulty of an intellectual sort about gaining new information in the course of reading if the new facts are of the same sort as those you already know. A person who knows some of the facts of American history and understands them in a certain light can readily acquire by reading, in the first sense, more such facts and understand them in the same light. But suppose he is reading a history that seeks not merely to give him some more facts but also to throw a new and perhaps more revealing light on <i>all</i> the facts he knows. Suppose there is greater understanding available here than he possessed before he started to read. If he can manage to acquire that greater understanding, he is reading in the second sense. He has indeed elevated himself by his activity, though indirectly, of course, the elevation was made possible by the writer who had something to teach him.<br><br>What are the conditions under which this kind of reading -- reading for understanding -- takes place? There are two. First, there is <i>initial inequality in understanding.</i> The writer must be "superior" to the reader in understanding, and his book must convey in readable form the insights he possesses and his potential readers lack. Second, <i>the reader must be able to overcome this inequality in some degree,</i> seldom perhaps fully, but always approaching equality with the writer. To the extent that equality is approached, clarity of communication is achieved.<br><br>In short, we can learn only from our "betters." We must know who they are and how to learn from them. The person who has this sort of knowledge possesses the art of reading in the sense with which we are especially concerned in this book. Everyone who can read at all probably has some ability to read in this way. But all of us, without exception, can learn to read better and gradually gain more by our efforts through applying them to more rewarding materials.<br><br>We do not want to give the impression that facts, leading to increased information, and insights, leading to increased understanding, are always easy to distinguish. And we would admit that sometimes a mere recital of facts can itself lead to greater understanding. The point we want to emphasize here is that this book is about the art of reading for the sake of increased understanding. Fortunately, if you learn to do that, reading for information will usually take care of itself.<br><br>Of course, there is still another goal of reading, besides gaining information and understanding, and that is entertainment. However, this book will not be much concerned with reading for entertainment. It is the least demanding kind of reading, and it requires the least amount of effort. Furthermore, there are no rules for it. Everyone who knows how to read at all can read for entertainment if he wants to.<br><br>In fact, any book that can be read for understanding or information can probably be read for entertainment as well, just as a book that is capable of increasing our understanding can also be read purely for the information it contains.

Presenting mathematical ideas of peoples from a variety of small-scale and traditional cultures, it humanizes our view of mathematics and expands our conception of what is mathematical.</p><br><p> Through engaging examples of how particular societies structure time, reach decisions about the future, make models and maps, systematize relationships, and create intriguing figures, Marcia Ascher demonstrates that traditional cultures have mathematical ideas that are far more substantial and sophisticated than is generally acknowledged. Malagasy divination rituals, for example, rely on complex algebraic algorithms. And some cultures use calendars far more abstract and elegant than our own. Ascher also shows that certain concepts assumed to be universal--that time is a single progression, for instance, or that equality is a static relationship--are not.

Yet it remains baffling in its variety of definitions, contexts and associations. <i>Beginning Postmodernism</i> aims to offer clear, accessible and step-by-step introductions to postmodernism across a wide range of subjects. It encourages readers to explore how the debates about postmodernism have emerged from basic philosophical and cultural ideas. With its emphasis firmly on "postmodernism in practice," the book contains exercises and questions designed to help readers understand and reflect upon a variety of positions in the following areas of contemporary culture: philosophy and cultural theory; architecture and concepts of space; visual art; sculpture and the design arts; popular culture and music; film, video and television culture; and the social sciences.<br></p><p>Tim Woods is Lecturer in English and American Studies at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth.<br>How ironic: a treatment of postmodernism that is, according to the blurb on the back cover, "clear, accessible and step-by-step." And yet it's true. Woods (Univ. of Wales, Aberystwyth; The Ethics in Literature) capably surveys the nearly impassable terrain of his subject without extenuating its quirks, subtleties, and controversies. In a series of chapters organized by discipline, he discusses manifestations of postmodernism in philosophy, literature, architecture, the visual arts, pop culture and music, film and video, and the social sciences. His inclusive approach treats postmodernism as a cultural condition, a critical perspective, and an aesthetic fashion. Students and curious general readers will appreciate Woods's carefully organized text and will want to investigate the numerous works he cites throughout. Intended primarily as a classroom text for undergraduates, this is the first book in the publisher's "Beginnings" series. Recommended for larger public and academic libraries.<br><i>-Dean C.

Patrick Galliou and Michael Jones draw upon a wide range of archaeological and literary material to explore the characteristics of a society which has combined peoples from two different linguistic and cultural traditions in a long-enduring political union. In the book&#39;s opening chapter Patrick Galliou describes early Armorica, the Gaulish name for Brittany, including its physical environment, the hunter-gatherer society of the paleolithic era, the farmers of the neolithic and the metal working communities of the Bronze Age. Both authors synthesize much recent research to examine such themes as trade, population and settlement, the economy, urbanization and transport, art and crafts and Breton religion, culture and political ideology. Michael Jones pays particular attention to the circumstances in which Brittany became a fully-fledged late medieval state whilst nominally remaining a part of the kingdom of France, and considers also the evolution of aristocratic power. He also focuses upon the external forces which shaped Breton society, notably the Carolingian, Anglo-Norman, Angevin and Capetian policies and such European religious movements as monastic reform. A concluding chapter reviews Breton history from the end of the Middle Ages to the present day.</p><p>This book draws upon a wide range of archaeological and literary material to provide a history of one of the most distinctive and individualistic regions of France and its people, from prehistoric times to the present. Focusing upon such themes as trade, settlement, agriculture, transport, population, religion, art and languages, the authors explore the characteristics of a society which has combined peoples from two different linguistic and cultural traditions in a long-enduring political union. <p>In the book's opening chapter, Patrick Galliou reconstructs early Armorica (the Gaulish name for Brittany) where as early as 5000 BC, under gradually changing physical conditions, human communities appeared in the peninsula and a highly idiosyncratic culture evolved. Dr Galliou traces the development of this culture through the later Neolithic, and the Bronze Age, to Roman and post-Roman Brittany. Beginning with the Frankish period, Michael Jones traces Breton history in the Middle Ages. He describes the rise and fall of the Kingdom of Brittany; the Plantagenets; the civil war (1341-65), and the medieval Breton state under the Montfort Dukes. He concludes with an overview of Brittany's history from the end of the Middle Ages to the present day.</p> <p>Extensively illustrated with half-tones, maps and diagrams, the book will be of wide interest to archaeologists, historians and anthropologists, as well as to the general reader.</p><b>Patrick Galliou</b> is Reader at the Universit� de Bretagne Occidentale (Brest) and also teaches at the Universit� of Haute Bretagne (Rennes).

It is included here in its entirety along with the best of her early poems. <br><br>Ana Castillo&#x2019;s poetry speaks&#x2014;in English and Spanish&#x2014;to every reader who has felt the pangs of exile, the uninterrupted joy of love, and the deep despair of love lost.</p><p>Ana Castillo is the author of the novels <b>Peel My Love Like an Onion</b><i>, </i><b>So Far from God</b><i>, </i><b>The Mixquiahuala Letters</b><i>, </i>and <b>Sapogonia</b>.

She lives in Chicago. Find out more about Castillo at her homepage: www.anacastillo.com.If fire and spirit could make interesting poems, then this collection would be very good indeed. Instead, we have mostly polemical poetry; as Castillo herself says, "my new speech is echoes/with the tongue that sounds/of tumbling wooden blocks." Castillo, who has also written three novels and four other collections of poetry (all published by small press publishers; some of the poems are republished here), writes in both English and Spanish (untranslated) about gritty urban subjects: welfare, suicide, street violence, affairs. The English poems lack music; for example, "Everywhere i go/i am asked my origin/as if i bore antennae/or the eye/of the Cyclops." Sometimes Castillo's grammar is at fault-e.g., "there's an empty chair past Egberto with bad breath"-but mostly these poems avoid reaching for mystery, as in these lines: "These days are getting shorter./The nights kept getting longer./ The kitchen clock starts ticking/louder." What Castillo does best is detail two cultures both clashing and commingling, but these poems only leave the reader wanting more mystery, more song.

We now have the technology to create games that look real! Sony's Playstation II, XBOX, and Game Cube are cool! But, all this technology isn't easy or trivial to understand - it takes really hard work and lots of Red Bull. The difficulty level of game programming has definitely been cranked up these days in relation to the skill set needed to make games. Andre LaMothe's follow-up book to <i>Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus</i> is the one to read for the latest in 3D game programming. When readers are finished with <i>Tricks of the 3D Game Programming Gurus-Advanced 3D Graphics and Rasterization</i>, they will be able to create a full 3D texture-mapped, lit video game for the PC with a software rasterizer they can write themselves. Moreover, they will understand the underlying principles of 3D graphics and be able to better understand and utilize 3D hardware today and in the future.</p></p><p>To be an ordinary programmer is one thing: You need only learn how to interact with the computer on its own terms, creating buttons and combo boxes that have no significance away from the screen. To be a game programmer--particularly one that writes games with environments that appear three-dimensional to their players--is something else entirely. Such work requires that the flat screen simulate the real world, complete with light, shading, texture, gravity, and momentum. It's all quite complicated. <i>Tricks of the 3D Game Programming Gurus</i> helps its readers make great progress in creating 3D worlds and the action that goes on in them.<p> That this large, dense book manages to explain how to design and implement a 3D game while neither glossing over too many details nor swamping the reader with trivia is a credit to author Andr� LaMothe. He opens by showing (and explaining) the C++ source code of a simple but full-fledged 3D spaceflight shooter game--a real boost to the reader's confidence. From there, he explains the complicated geometric concepts and mathematics that underlie realistic games (always with an eye toward software algorithms) and shows how to use the many APIs and libraries (including Microsoft DirectX 9.0) that make the world-builder's job easier. Make no mistake: Designing and building convincing games with 3D visuals and behaviors that convincingly approximate real-world physics is hard work. In this book, LaMothe helps you get it done and enjoy the process. <i>--David Wall</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: How to design and build 3D worlds and the goings-on within them.

The model was originally conceived by observing successful product developers as they drove bold and major innovations to market. Those early observations led to the conclusion that there was a "better way"--that some innovation teams and project leaders had intuitively figured it out. I tried to capture their <i>secrets to success</i> on paper, and so was born the <i>Stage-Gate</i> system. Thus, <i>Stage-Gate</i> is an idea-to-launch process, but one that encompasses a body of knowledge and best practices. Those best practices embedded within today's <i>Stage-Gate</i> are now based on studies of thousands of successful new-product developments and hundreds of companies, and reveal what the winners do differently from the rest.<br> &nbsp;<br> The emphasis in this fourth edition of <i>Winning at New Products</i> is on <i>bold innovation</i>. I've watched as companies, a few industries excepted, have shifted their innovation efforts from true innovations and major projects to much smaller and less ambitious attempts over the last decade or so. It's somewhat disheartening to see what these companies are calling "innovation," versus what it should be. In some firms, product development has been totally trivialized - it's "renovation" rather than innovation. I hope this fourth edition does sound a wake-up call telling you that <i>true innovation</i> and <i>bold product development</i> is within your grasp. So let's get back to basics and to what made companies great in the first place: The success drivers outlined in the first few chapters and the <i>Stage-Gate</i> system are all based on bolder innovation--let's use them!<br> &nbsp;<br> The first edition of this book was published in 1986, before I had even begun to use the term "stage-gate." That first book reported the results of a number of research studies that colleagues and I had undertaken on new-product success and failure. And it proposed the use of a systematic idea-to-launch business process for the first time. To my surprise, the book had a profound impact on the way many companies approached product development, and firms such as P&amp;G, DuPont, and Exxon Chemicals immediately embraced the concept of my stage-and-gate system.<br> &nbsp;<br> But those were the early days of management of the innovation process. More research was undertaken, including some that focused on these early adopters of <i>Stage-Gate</i>. More success factors were uncovered in our NewProd research series and in our major benchmarking studies that followed; and more experiences were gained with the use of <i>Stage-Gate</i> methods (I first used the term "<i>Stage-Gate</i>" in an article that appeared in the <i>Journal of Marketing Management</i> in 1988). And so the second edition was published in 1993. It went on to become the bible for those businesses trying to overhaul their new-product process and implement <i>Stage-Gate</i>. And the third edition in 2000 continued the tradition, but with an emphasis on accelerating idea-to-launch.<br> &nbsp;<br> This current edition is more than a simple updating of the third edition, however. There is much that is new in it. Some years have passed since I wrote the previous edition, and much more has been learned. Colleagues and I have undertaken major benchmarking studies to uncover and validate best practices in product innovation methods, portfolio management, strategy development, and idea generation. Some practices were well known and our work served to validate them and quantify their effects; but others are new. These new research avenues and their findings have been incorporated into this current book. Additionally, we now have much more experience and insight into the installation of <i>Stage-Gate</i> in leading firms worldwide. And these new insights have also been built into the current edition.<br> &nbsp;<br> But there's another reason for this new book: <i>Stage-Gate</i> itself has evolved and morphed--it's an evergreen process, not because of my colleagues and me and our research, but because of the many users globally! In other words, inputs from many people and firms--open innovation--have helped to redefine <i>Stage-Gate</i>. With thousands of users globally, it's inevitable that new twists, approaches, and methods are uncovered, tested, proven, and incorporated into their idea-to-launch systems. <i>Stage-Gate</i> is now faster and more streamlined: Many firms have borrowed the concepts of lean manufacturing and built these into <i>Stage-Gate</i>. The next-generation <i>Stage-Gate</i> process, or elements of it, has been implemented by a number of firms. Portfolio management has been integrated with gating methods, and the concepts of "lean gates" and "gates with teeth" have been fashioned into the system in order to make sharper and more effective investment decisions. And <i>Stage-Gate</i> approaches have even been extended to other types of projects, including technology developments. And there's more: <i>Stage-Gate</i> has been made more adaptive, agile, and flexible; it's been modified to suit the new world of <i>open innovation</i><i>;</i> and it's been automated. So much that's new makes today's <i>Stage-Gate</i> hardly recognizable to early adopters of the original process!<br> &nbsp;<br> A number of people have provided insights, guidance, content, and encouragement in the writing of this new book. A close colleague is Scott Edgett. Scott is recognized as a leading researcher in the field of innovation management and was a co-researcher and co-author of the series of research studies, reports, and articles on the topic of portfolio management and benchmarking best practices. He is also a director and CEO of the Product Development Institute Inc. Elko J. Kleinschmidt is both a longtime colleague and friend. He and I have undertaken many research studies over the years, and many are referenced in this edition. The folks at Stage-Gate International, who are the professionals who implement <i>Stage-Gate</i> in firms globally, are a constant source of new thinking and validation of concepts. In particular, I thank Michelle Jones, vice president at Stage-Gate International, for insights and materials regarding implementation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Several other people merit special attention. Jens Arleth in Denmark is managing director of Innovation Management U3 in Copenhagen, a consulting firm that specializes in <i>Stage-Gate</i> and portfolio management. He has introduced these concepts into Scandinavia, where they are now employed at leading firms throughout the region. He is also the co-developer of the ProBE diagnostic tool, the predecessor to Benchmarker&#x2122; (in Appendix A). Angelika Dreher and Peter Fuerst, managing partners at Five I's Innovation Management in Austria, have taken up the challenge of implementing <i>Stage-Gate</i> in German-speaking countries and have provided insights and examples that have found their way into this book. Gerard Ryan, managing director of Prodex Systems in Australia, implements <i>Stage-Gate</i> and automation software for the system in Australia and New Zealand, and also provided many useful insights and experiences.<br> &nbsp;<br> Direct assistance was provided by several people: I would also like to thank my publisher, John Sherer of Basic Books (Perseus Books), who provided encouragement and adeptly steered the progress of this book from inception to launch. And thanks to Michelle Welsh-Horst, senior project editor, Perseus Books Group, for ensuring that this book came to press so efficiently and effectively. And I especially thank Michele Wynn, copy editor, who suffered through my writing and helped craft this fine finished product... a great job!For more than two decades, <i>Winning at New Products</i> has served as the bible for product developers everywhere.

As he weaves his arid yarns, we suddenly realize that our normal view of the world has been turned on its head: where we once saw scarcity, there is abundance; where we once perceived severity, there is whimsy. Desert cultures that we once assumed lived in &#x201c;food deserts&#x201d; are secretly savoring a most delicious world.</p> <p>Drawing on his half-century of immersion in desert ethnobotany, ecology, linguistics, agroforestry, and eco-gastronomy, Nabhan opens up for us a hidden world that we had never glimpsed before. Along the way, he explores the sensuous reality surrounding this most useful and generous tree.</p> <p><em>Mesquite</em> is a book that will delight mystics and foresters, naturalists and foodies. It combines cutting-edge science with a generous sprinkling of humor and folk wisdom, even including traditional recipes for cooking with mesquite.</p></p><p><p>Gary Paul Nabhan is an internationally celebrated nature writer, food and farming activist, and proponent of conserving the links between biodiversity and cultural diversity. He holds the W.K. Kellogg Endowed Chair in Sustainable Food Systems at the University of Arizona Southwest Center, where he works with students, faculty, and non-profits to build a more just, nutritious, sustainable, and climate-resilient foodshed spanning the US/Mexico border. He&#x2019;s also the author of numerous books, including <em>Growing Food in a Hotter, Drier Land</em>,<em> Renewing America&#x2019;s Food Traditions</em>, and <em>Chasing Chiles.</em> He lives in southern Arizona.</p><p><strong><em>Choice Reviews</em>&#x2015;</strong></p> <p>"Nabhan teaches ecological lessons to nonscientists through an impressive range of disciplines: ancient history, ethnobiology, paleo-nutrition, ecology, history, anthropology, and more. In each of 16 chapters, he examines one facet of this fascinating shrub: how it grows and spreads, how its wood is used for fence posts and for exquisite woodcrafting, and, centrally, how its pods have been used for centuries as food (recipes included). . . . In a conceit that begins and ends each chapter, [Nabhan] confesses his secret: he has come to think of the mesquite as a lover, and he is gradually transforming into one himself."</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><strong><em>&#x2015;</em></strong></p> <p>"An unconventional ode to the wonders of mesquite. Call it a love affair or an obsession: Award-winning nature writer and ethnobiologist Nabhan (<em>Ethnobiology for the Future: Linking Cultural and Ecological Diversity</em>, 2016, etc.) has a thing for mesquite. Early on he writes rapturously of his desire to become a tree, or at least to become more like a tree&#x2015;and not just any tree. In his view, the mesquite is of singular importance as an icon, a framer of one's worldview, a foodstuff, a beverage, a seasoning, a medicine, an antiseptic, a source of fiber and fuel, and a resource for architects and artisans. The author also argues that mesquite has feelings and intelligence, defending this thesis with down-to-earth stories about its remarkable abilities to heal itself, to engage with and offer nourishment and pleasure to its flora and fauna neighbors, and to shape its environment. Nabhan has clearly spent considerable time as an observer of mesquite, and he has a way with words, sometimes punning, sometimes waxing poetic, and never, it seems, holding back in his enthusiasm for his subject. He invites readers to pledge allegiance with him 'to this flagship species of the United Desert States of America, and to the mycorrhizal mass on which it stands, one cohesive nation in all creation, its flora and fauna indivisible, with love fests and wild times for all.' Mixed into this odd, sometimes preachy, and often emotional m�lange is plenty of solid information about mesquite, its history, and its utility. An activist in the local food movement, Nabhan concludes with 11 mesquite recipes, some quite labor intensive, and detailed instructions for harvesting and processing the pods. A charming yet quirky book that may puzzle readers outside the deserts of the American Southwest, who are accustomed only to supermarket bags of mesquite for their charcoal smokers.&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;By turns informative, playful, funny, and wise, <em>Mesquite</em> is a fascinating, tour de force illumination of the natural, cultural, and spiritual value of a truly remarkable desert tree. Gary Nabhan&#x2019;s gift to readers is the imaginative and redemptive suggestion that we still have plenty to learn from the more-than-human world that flourishes even under the harshest conditions. A gem from one of our finest western American writers, <em>Mesquite</em> is a spectacular accomplishment and a wonderfully entertaining read.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Michael P. Branch, author of <em>Rants from the Hill</em> and <em>How to Cuss in Western</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;With a reverently irreverent blend of natural history, magical realism, social commentary, and humor, Nabhan invites us to fall in love with one of America&#x2019;s most misunderstood and maligned plants. Masterfully performing the great sleight of hand trick of classic nature writing, Nabhan employs close observation of the outside world to go deeper within.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Liz Carlisle, author of <em>Lentil Underground</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In this rapturous, provocative, and intimate book, Gary Paul Nabhan takes readers on his quest for symbiosis with mesquite! It&#x2019;s a paean to the venerable desert legume, a humorous meditation on human knowledge, and a somewhat Kafkaesque journey into the&nbsp;deep state&nbsp;of vegetal oneness with a tree. It is full of wry observations, heartfelt hopefulness, and vivid stories&#x2015;with a big dash of trippy fun!&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Courtney White, author of&nbsp;<em>Grass, Soil, Hope</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Two-Percent Solutions</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;It seems that Gary Paul Nabhan has been experiencing a case of mesquiten identity! In this book we learn how he came to belong to the genus <em>Prosopis</em>. Along the way we also learn about mesquite biology, evolution, ecology, culture, cuisine, and conservation. Like the mesquite, Gary is deep-rooted in our arid landscapes and communities. He crosses borders. He bears blossoms of wit and pods of knowledge. As he finds himself transformed, so does the reader. We become a bit more mesquite-like ourselves&#x2015;and, somehow, that much more human.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Curt Meine, conservation biologist; senior fellow, The Aldo Leopold Foundation</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Delicious!

A &#x201c;natural and extraordinary talent for letter writing was one of the most captivating facets of his nature,&#x201d; writes Gershom Scholem in his Foreword to this volume; and Benjamin's correspondence reveals the evolution of some of his most powerful ideas, while also offering an intimate picture of Benjamin himself and the times in which he lived.Writing at length to Scholem and Theodor Adorno, and exchanging letters with Rainer Maria Rilke, Hannah Arendt, Max Brod, and Bertolt Brecht, Benjamin elaborates on his ideas about metaphor and language. He reflects on literary figures from Kafka to Karl Kraus, and expounds his personal attitudes toward such subjects as Marxism and French national character. Providing an indispensable tool for any scholar wrestling with Benjamin&#x2019;s work, <i>The Correspondence of Walter Benjamin, 1910&#x2013;1940</i> is a revelatory look at the man behind much of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most significant criticism.<p></p></p><p>Called &#34;the most important critic of his time&#34; by Hannah Arendt, Walter Benjamin has emerged as one of the most compelling thinkers of our time as well, his work assuming a crucial place in current debates over the interactions of art, culture, and meaning. A &#34;natural and extraordinary talent for letter writing was one of the most captivating facets of his nature,&#34; writes Gershom Scholem in his Foreword; and indeed, Benjamin&#39;s correspondence reveals the evolution of some of his most powerful ideas. Published here in English for the first time, these letters offer an intimate picture of Benjamin himself and the times in which he lived. Written in a day when letters were an important vehicle for the presentation and development of intellectual matters, Benjamin&#39;s correspondence is rich in insight into the circumstances behind his often difficult work. These letters provide a lively view of Benjamin&#39;s life and thought from his days as a student to his melancholy experiences as an exile in Paris. As he defends his changing ideas to admiring and skeptical friends - poets, philosophers, and radicals - we witness the restless self-analysis of a creative mind far in advance of his own time. Writing at length to Scholem and Theodor Adorno, and exchanging letters with Rainer Maria Rilke, Hannah Arendt, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Max Horkheimer, Max Brod, Bertolt Brecht, and Kafka&#39;s friend Felix Weltsch, Benjamin elaborates his ideas about metaphor and language. He reflects on literary figures from Kafka to Karl Kraus, the &#34;Jewish Question&#34; and anti-Semitism, Marxism and Zionism. And he expounds his personal attitudes toward such subjects as the role of quotations in criticism, history, and tradition; the meaning of being a &#34;collector&#34;; and French culture and the national character. In sum, this magnificent collection is an exceptionally rich source of information and an essential key to understanding one of the preeminent figures of modern culture.<p><b>Walter Benjamin </b>(1892&#x2013;1940) was a German philosopher, writer, and literary critic.</p></p><h2>Understanding Cultures through Their Key Words: English, Russian, Polish, German, and Japanese (Oxford Studies in Anthropological Linguistics, 8)</h2><p>This book develops the dual themes that languages can differ widely in their vocabularies, and are also sensitive indices to the cultures to which they belong. Wierzbicka seeks to demonstrate that every language has "key concepts," expressed in "key words," which reflect the core values of a given culture. She shows that cultures can be revealingly studied, compared, and explained to outsiders through their key concepts, and that the analytical framework necessary for this purpose is provided by the "natural semantic metalanguage," based on lexical universals, that the author and colleagues have developed on the basis of wide-ranging cross-linguistic investigations. Appealing to anthropologists, psychologists, and philosophers as well as linguists, this book demonstrates that cultural patterns can be studied in a verifiable, rigorous, and non-speculative way, on the basis of empirical evidence and in a coherent theoretical framework.<br></p><p><br>Dr. Anna Wierzbicka is Professor of Linguistics at the Australian National University.

Bound in real cloth, printed on high quality paper, and featuring ribbon markers and gilt edges, Macmillan Collector's Library are books to love and treasure. </p><p>In <i>Julius Caesar</i>, William Shakespeare exploits the most notorious murder in classical history to tell a tragic tale of friendship, ambition and betrayal. As the greatest figures of the Roman Republic are swept along on the tide of a terrifying conspiracy, a touchingly human story is revealed in some of the most beautiful poetry ever written.</p><p>Illustrated throughout by Sir John Gilbert (1817-1897), famous for his depictions of historical scenes. As well as Shakespeare, he illustrated works of Sir Walter Scott, Cervantes, Wilkie Collins and Wordsworth.</p><p>With an Afterword by Ned Halley.</p></p><p>William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, in 1564. The date of his birth is not known but is traditionally 23 April, St George's Day. Aged 18, he married a Stratford farmer's daughter, Anne Hathaway. They had three children. Around 1585 William joined an acting troupe on tour in Stratford from London, and thereafter spent much of his life in the capital. <i>Julius Caesar</i>, one of four plays Shakespeare set in ancient Rome, was probably written in 1599 and also first performed in that year. A member of the leading theatre group in London, the Chamberlain's Men, which built the Globe Theatre and frequently performed in front of Queen Elizabeth I, Shakespeare wrote 36 plays and much poetry besides. He died in 1616.Part of L.A. Theatre Works&#39; The Play&#39;s the Thing series, this production is a stellar example of the ensemble&#39;s talent. There&#39;s a perfect balance between human voice and background music/sound effects. The all-American cast provides a fresh and equally professional approach to this classic, which is typically performed by British actors. In addition, the production quality is excellent; the depth of the &#34;stage&#34; seems apparent as audiences hear actors at different volume levels, which helps to suggest their proximity to the main character in each scene. Overall, Julius Caesar is a wonderful addition to any audio theater library R.A.P.

Focusing on a phenomenon commonly called &#34;women&#39;s language,&#34; in modern Japanese society, Miyako Inoue considers the history and social effects of this language form. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in a contemporary Tokyo corporation to study the everyday linguistic experience of white-collar females office workers and on historical research from the late nineteenth century to 1930, she calls into question the claim that &#34;women&#39;s language&#34; is a Japanese cultural tradition of ancient origin and offers a critical geneaology showing the extent to which this language form is, in fact, a cultural construct linked with Japan&#39;s national and capitalist modernity. Her theoretically sophisticated, empirically grounded, interdisciplinary work brilliantly illuminates the relationship between culture and language, the nature of power and subject formation in modernity, and how the complex nexus of gender, language, and political economy are experienced in everyday life.</p><p>"Inoue has accomplished an extraordinary task, which is without precedent in the East Asian Fields. To my knowledge, no author has ever demonstrated as persuasively as she does that the issues concerning women's Japanese can be explored in such an innovative, engaging way.&nbsp; <i>Vicarious Language</i> brilliantly displays how effectively Foucauldian archaeology can be introduced to the study of gender and language, and undermines any of the previous studies in English of what is erroneously referred to as the unique feature of the Japanese language. This is a superb model of engaged scholarship."&#x2015;Naoki Sakai, author of <i>Voices of the Past: The Status of Language in Eighteenth-Century Japanese Discourse</i><br><br>"Miyako Inoue's <i>Vicarious Language </i>is a work of scholarly distinction and cultural insight. She explores the texture of Japanese modernity, its national rituals and social practices, by way of a sustained, semiotic analysis of womens' language&#x2015;the language of self-expression that women use in intimate and institutional contexts, and the language used to define the gendered roles assigned to women within the powers of patriarchy. Her sources range widely from scholarly studies to the 'popular opinion' fostered by newspapers and advertisements; her excellent ethnography investigates the strategies of institutions and organisations, while inquiring into the politics and poetics of everyday life; her analytic method is, at once, conceptually sophisticated and textually intensive. This is a work that allows you to participate in the lifeworld of the Japanese language, at the illuminating moment when gender relations are writ large in the social syntax of national life. This is a book that will make a lasting impression on a range of disciplines."&#x2015;Homi K. Bhabha, Anne F.Rothenberg Professor, Harvard University<b>Miyako Inoue</b> is Assistant Professor in the Department of Cultural and Social Anthropology at Stanford University.</p><h2>Lee Mullican: An Abundant Harvest Of Sun</h2><p>Lee Mullican&#39;s paintings and drawings map the inner space of the mind and the outer space of the cosmos. Over a 50-year career, in works bursting with color, he sought a window onto the unconscious, without relinquishing the control of a skilled draftsman or references to the world around him. Influenced by Native American art and Surrealism, as well as Eastern religions like Buddhism and Hinduism, in 2005 Mullican&#39;s formidable oeuvre gets an overdue retrospective, organized by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. This exhibition catalogue is the most comprehensive collection of his work and includes an essay by organizing curator Carol S. Eliel and an homage to Mullican as a teacher and mentor by fellow Los Angeles painter Lari Pittman. Like another Lee (Bontecou) whose quiet career of working and teaching recently got a deserving retrospective, Mullican will emerge here as an American original.</p><p></p><h2>Dr. Patrick Walsh&#39;s Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer</h2><p>Major medical breakthroughs are enabling more and more men to survive prostate cancer.

WALSH, M.D., the world's foremost authority on prostate cancer, is the professor of urology and director of the Brady of Urological INstitue at the Johns Hopikns Medical Institutions in Baltimore, Maryland.<br> JANET FARRAR WORTHINGTON is an award-winning science writer and the former editor of the nationally acclaimed <em>Hopkins Medical News</em>.Walsh, professor of urology at Johns Hopkins University, and Worthington, a medical writer, offer a thorough guide to one of the most frightening diseases for men. Starting with an explanation of how the prostrate works surprisingly, it's not an essential organ Walsh then discusses why prostate cancer is prevalent in the U.S. and other developed Western countries, but not in Asia. He also detail the reasons men develop prostate cancer, including age, race, family history and diet. The book describes a variety of symptoms, some of which indicate ailments other than cancer, and what steps should be taken to get a proper diagnosis. Complete with diagrams and charts detailing the results of biopsy, the book provides an exceptionally complete (albeit worrisome, for squeamish readers) overview of the disease. Many of these details not taking aspirin prior to a biopsy, taking antibiotics ahead of time should obviously be included in the information doctors routinely provide to patients, but given the state of today's medical system, having such information available in this ready guide is useful and reassuring. Similarly comprehensive and easy-to-understand explanations are provided for surgical and other types of treatment, side effects, postsurgical complications and more, as well as a glossary of medical terms, along with a brief resource section. While people shouldn't use this book as a substitute for a medical check-up, it is one of the best all-inclusive books on this subject. All men and their loved ones battling or concerned about prostate cancer should read this book. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>On Size and Life</h2><p>Considers the role of shape and size in natural selection, looks at growth, biological structure, and locomotion, and discusses the effect of scale on living organisms</p><p></p><h2>Anatomy of the Dicotyledons: Volume I: Systematic Anatomy of the Leaf and Stem, with a Brief History of the Subject</h2><p>This revised edition of Volume II of the Anatomy of the Dicotyledons completes the general introduction to plant anatomy provided by this established botanical reference work.

The authors are able to demystify the drawing process without sacrificing an understanding of its expressive power or of the complexity of artistic ideas it embodies. The inclusion of a diverse range of artists and artworks illustrates an equally diverse range of ideas that are made relevant to the act of drawing." - Ruth Trotter, The University of La Verne<br><br>"The authors write beautifully on the philosophy of drawing and art and seem committed to educating readers on the changes that drawing has undergone in the last hundred years. They show us with a number of vivid illustrations and examples that drawing is a unique art form capable of bringing out the most creative impulses that an artist might be searching for...""[They] have written a comprehensive exploration of the complexities of drawing today. They show us, through historical references with descriptive and inspirational illustrations, how drawing has progressed from its status as a preliminary layout tool to an art form in its own right....""DRAWING: A CONTEMPORARY APPROACH is an important text for anyone interested in drawing as it is currently being practiced. It allows us to see the possibilities within what the authors reveal as an exciting and dynamic medium." - Craig Lloyd, College of Mt. Saint Joseph<br><br>"I found myself really inspired by the smart and fresh approaches to student projects. As a whole, I thought they functioned well as an intersection of new and old approaches to drawing, touching on obvious, time-tested approaches such as continuous contour of plants, but also opening up the idea of drawing to new techniques such as copy machine transfer...""It is rare that a book can communicate effectively across the landscape of art, addressing the multivalent range of students' experience levels and interests. I believe this book does an exemplary job of addressing students' needs as both thinkers and makers, and I would gladly use this text in my classroom." - Dylan Collins, Kent State University</p><h2>The Long Reach of the Sixties: LBJ, Nixon, and the Making of the Contemporary Supreme Court</h2><p>The Warren Court of the 1950s and 1960s was the most liberal in American history. Yet within a few short years, new appointments redirected the Court in a more conservative direction, a trend that continued for decades. However, even after Warren retired and the makeup of the court changed, his Court cast a shadow that extends to our own era. <br><br>In <em>The Long Reach of the Sixties</em>, Laura Kalman focuses on the late 1960s and early 1970s, when Presidents Johnson and Nixon attempted to dominate the Court and alter its course. Using newly released--and consistently entertaining--recordings of Lyndon Johnson's and Richard Nixon's telephone conversations, she roots their efforts to mold the Court in their desire to protect their Presidencies. The fierce ideological battles--between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches--that ensued transformed the meaning of the Warren Court in American memory. Despite the fact that the Court's decisions generally reflected public opinion, the surrounding debate calcified the image of the Warren Court as activist and liberal. Abe Fortas's embarrassing fall and Nixon's campaign against liberal justices helped make the term "activist Warren Court" totemic for liberals and conservatives alike. <br><br>The fear of a liberal court has changed the appointment process forever, Kalman argues. Drawing from sources in the Ford, Reagan, Bush I, and Clinton presidential libraries, as well as the justices' papers, she shows how the desire to avoid another Warren Court has politicized appointments by an order of magnitude. Among other things, presidents now almost never nominate politicians as Supreme Court justices (another response to Warren, who had been the governor of California). Sophisticated, lively, and attuned to the ironies of history, <em>The Long Reach of the Sixties </em>is essential reading for all students of the modern Court and U.S. political history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Laura Kalman</strong> is Professor of History at the University of California, Santa Barbara, a member of the California Bar, and past president of the American Society for Legal History.

When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children&#x2014;an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare&#x2019;s only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s.

The text emphasizes the interplay of law, ideology, politics, and economic change in shaping constitutional thought, and provides a historical perspective on the contemporary debate about property rights. Ely examines such issues as the link between private property and political liberty, the extent to which the government may interfere with private contracts, and the manner in which discourse about private property changed as American society became industrialized.<br>Now in its second edition, <em>The Guardian of Every Other Right</em> has been revised to take into account the heightened interest in the constitutional rights of property owners since the first edition appeared in 1991. It focuses on the major legal developments in the field of property rights and offers a full treatment of important judicial decisions and notable legislation during the 1990s. Particular attention is paid to the Supreme Court decisions which have enlarged the protection afforded property owners under the fifth amendment. It also examines the reach of federal authority under the commerce clause and the important innovations at the state level. Covering the entire history of property rights, the revised edition of The Guardian of Every Other Right fills an important gap in the literature of constitutional history and is an ideal text for legal and constitutional history courses.</p><p>James W.

He shows how the paintings of Matisse and others engaged many pressing issues of the day and simultaneously camouflaged that engagement, and he discusses the sources and implications of that phenomenon. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Revealing his enthusiasm for the Fauve painting of the first decade of the 20th century, Herbert admittedly "cobbles together... a negotiation across time" through his interpretations of various audiences and associations contemporary with Fauvism. Concentrating on the works of Matisse, Derain, and Vlaminck, he enters into a detailed discussion comparing their paintings with various other movements from Impressionism to Cubism, interspersing critical and literary references and snippets of the history surrounding the period. Crammed with facts, this book often reads like a lecture series, but it does include 18 color plates and 75 black-and- white illustrations.

In this revealing new biography, author Martin Kitchen disputes Speer&#x2019;s lifelong assertions of ignorance and innocence, portraying a far darker figure who was deeply implicated in the appalling crimes committed by the regime he served so well.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kitchen reconstructs Speer&#x2019;s life with what we now know, including information from valuable new sources that have come to light only in recent years, challenging the portrait presented by earlier biographers and by Speer himself of a cultured technocrat devoted to his country while completely uninvolved in Nazi politics and crimes. The result is the first truly serious accounting of the man, his beliefs, and his actions during one of the darkest epochs in modern history, not only countering Speer&#x2019;s claims of non-culpability but also disputing the commonly held misconception that it was his unique genius alone that kept the German military armed and fighting long after its defeat was inevitable.</p><p>A fascinating new life of Albert Speer, Germany&#x2019;s chief architect and Minister of Armaments during World War II, reveals Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s trusted confidant to have been far more devoted to National Socialist regime ideologies and complicit in its crimes than previously believed.<b>Martin Kitchen </b>is professor emeritus of history at Simon Fraser University and the author of numerous books on European and German history.

At first glance, the view might seem to be of the conventional landscape of modernization, but I hope a steady gaze will reveal it to be far vaster and more complex. For one thing, rather than enumerating the benefits accruing to Latin America as modernization became a dominant feature of the social, economic, and political life of the region, this essay regards the imposition of modernization as the catalyst of a devastating cultural struggle and as a barrier to Latin America's development. Clearly if a window to the past is opened by this essay, then so too is a new door to controversy.&nbsp;After most of the nations of Latin America gained political independence, their leaders rapidly accelerated trends more leisurely under way since the closing decades of the eighteenth century: the importation of technology and ideas with their accompanying values from Western Europe north of the Pyrenees and the full entrance into the world's capitalistic marketplace. Such trends shaped those new nations more profoundly than their advocates probably had realized possible. Their promoters moved forward steadfastly within the legacy of some basic institutions bequeathed by centuries of Iberian rule. That combination of hoary institutions with newer, non-Iberian technology, values, and ideas forged contemporary Latin America with its enigma of overwhelming poverty amid potential plenty.&nbsp;This essay emphasizes that the victory of the European oriented ruling elites over the Latin American folk with their community values resulted only after a long and violent struggle, which characterized most of the nineteenth century. Whatever advantages might have resulted from the success of the elites, the victory also fastened two dominant and interrelated characteristics on contemporary Latin America: a deepening dependency and the declining quality of life for the majority.</p><p>"Put this at the top of your reading list. It addresses 'the major enigma of Latin America: prevalent poverty in a potentially wealthy region.'"--<i>Times of Americas</i>&nbsp;"The well-documented thesis of this book is that the victory of the European-oriented ruling class over the Latin American folk, with their community values, fastensed on contemporary Latin America a deepening dependency and the declining quality of life for the majority. In the process the lack of social and economic justice engendered violence. . . . A significant contribution."--<i>Latin America in Books</i>&nbsp;"A thought-provoking argument about Latin America that forces us to come to grips with all effects of the panacea called development."--<i>Caribbean Review</i><b>Bradford E.

What does it portend when you break a double-yolked egg? Or when you witness a headless shadow? How many frogs do you need to cure whooping cough? And what's all this about black cats?<br> Ranging from the familiar to the bizarre, and including everything from spells and omens to rituals and taboos, this delightfully informative dictionary covers a wide array of popular superstitions, touching on virtually every aspect of human culture. They embrace family life and the lore of farmers, sailors, miners, and actors; offer advice on the signs to observe when contemplating a journey or a marriage; reveal the significance of animals, plants, stones, colors, food and drink, the elements, and heavenly bodies; outline the precautions to be taken after a death in the house or during a thunderstorm; and disclose the motives behind seasonal customs at New Year, in May, at Halloween, and Christmas. Each entry is arranged alphabetically according to its central idea or object, and illustrated with a selection of chronologically ordered quotations that indicate the history and development of each belief. And a thematic index helps the reader discover surprisingly coherent patterns in these mysterious and often misunderstood methods of comprehending the world and overcomingits perils, and shows the strong underlying connections with witchcraft and pagan religions.<br> Superstitions have never before been treated in such depth or on such a scale.

Radford's Encyclopedia of Superstitions (Greenwood, 1969. reprint). Its two major flaws are a failure to spell out clearly at the beginning of each entry exactly what superstition is being covered and a tendency to plunge immediately into ancient examples of folk wisdom or incidents on the subject. This is not so much a dictionary as a trove of historical examples of superstitious behavior. As such, it has a very limited appeal to advanced scholars and limited appeal to libraries. It could, however, serve as a back-up for those who want further information not found in works like that of the Radfords.<br><i>- Gordon Stein, Univ. of Rhode Island Lib., Kingston</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ma Rainey&#39;s Black Bottom</h2><p><p>In a jazz-era Chicago recording studio, musicians await the great blues diva.</p></p><p>August Wilson is the most influential and successful African American playwright writing today.

The environmental emphasis, which is unique among introductory botany texts, provides students with relevancy and kindles their interest in plants.

Why try? These are the issues that Carl Mitcham addresses in this work, a comprehensive, critical introduction to the philosophy of technology and a discussion of its sources and uses.<br> <br> Tracing the changing meaning of "technology" from ancient times to our own, Mitcham identifies the most important traditions of critical analysis of technology: the engineering approach, which assumes the centrality of technology in human life; and the humanities approach, which is concerned with its moral and cultural boundaries.<br> <br> Mitcham bridges these two traditions through an analysis of discussions of engineering design, of the distinction between tools and machines, and of engineering science itself. He looks at technology as it is experienced in everyday life&#x2014;as material objects (from kitchenware to computers), as knowledge ( including recipes, rules, theories, and intuitive "know-how"), as activity (design, construction, and use), and as volition (knowing how to use technology and understanding its consequences). By elucidating these multiple aspects, Mitcham establishes criteria for a more comprehensive analysis of ethical issues in applications of science and technology.<br> <br> This book will guide anyone wanting to reflect on technology and its moral implications.</p></p><p>This work aspires to be a critical introduction to the philosophy of technology. This represents but another step in a continuing concern for the philosophical issues associated with technology.In this critical introduction to the philosophy behind and about technology, defined here as "the making and using of artifacts," the essential conflict that Mitcham studies is over the control of our technologies. One camp believes that it is humans who control and direct technologies, choosing those that we will use and discarding others. The opposing camp worries that technology drives forward by its own momentum, structuring humankind's existence after the fact. Mitcham evaluates each side, arguing that the more complete answer is somewhere in the middle, between the choices we make and the demands our creations do certainly place on us. Included are the views of major philosophers and critical thinkers. A sound basis for future analysis of the many ethical issues inherent in our technological lives. <i>Brian McCombie</i></p><h2>Atala / Rene</h2><p>Chateaubriand was the giant of French literature in the early nineteenth century. Drawing on eighteenth-century English romanticists, on explorers in America, and on Goethe's Werther, he had a profound effect on French writers from Victor Hugo and Lamartine to George Sand and Flaubert. A quixotic and paradoxical personality, he combined impressive careers as a brilliant prose-poet, a spiritual guide, a high-ranking diplomat, and an enterprising lover.<br><br>Atala and Ren� are his two best-known works, reflecting not only his own joys, aspirations, and despair, but the emerging tastes of a new literary era. Atala is the passionate and tragic love story of a young Indian couple wandering in the wilderness, enthralled by the beauties of nature, drawn to a revivified Christianity by its esthetic charm and consoling beneficence, and finally succumbing to the cruelty of fate. Perhaps even more than Werther or Childe Harold, Ren� embodies the romantic hero, and is not wholly foreign to the disorientation of youth today. Solitary, mysterious, ardent, and poetic, he is in open revolt against a society whose values he rejects. Withough question this archetype played a large part in determining the course of French literature up to the 1850's.</p><p></p><h2>History Beyond the Text: A Student&#x2019;s Guide to Approaching Alternative Sources (Routledge Guides to Using Historical Sources)</h2><p><p>Historians are increasingly looking beyond the traditional, and turning to visual, oral, aural, and virtual sources to inform their work.

Others who may find it useful are experienced teachers who want to continue developing their teaching skills and curriculum specialists and school administrators who want a current, practical, and concise text of methods, guidelines, and resources for teaching grades 7-12. </p> <p><b>NEW TO THIS EDITION</b></p> <p> Chapter 1 is a better organized and more focused overview of secondary school teaching today. A new chapter, Chapter 2, is devoted to secondary school students, their diversity, and specific ways of working with them in the classroom. These topics were part of Chapter 1 in the previous editi6n. </p> <p> Although separated in this book for reasons of organizational clarity, "establishing and managing the learning environment" is an integral and ongoing component of planning and implementing curriculum and instruction. Chapter 4, about establishing a supportive classroom learning environment, is now titled Planning the Classroom Learning Environment, and has moved from Part I to Part II, where it is the first of three chapters about Planning for Instruction. The other two chapters of Part II are "Planning the Curriculum and Its Content" and "Planning the Instructional Unit with Lessons." </p> <p> Part III now includes four rather than five chapters. </p> <p> Other changes made for this edition are mentioned in the paragraphs that follow. </p> <p><b>OUR BELIEFS: HOW AND WHERE THEY ARE REFLECTED IN THIS BOOK</b></p> <p> In preparing this book, we saw our task <i>not</i> as making the teaching job easier for you&#x2014;exemplary teaching is never easy&#x2014;but as improving your teaching effectiveness and providing relevant guidelines and current resources. You may choose from these resources and build upon what works best for you. Nobody can tell you what will work with your students; you will know them best. We do share what we believe to be the best of practice, the most useful of recent research findings, and the richest of experiences. Preparing this new edition presented us with an opportunity to reexamine and share our own beliefs about secondary school teaching. The boldface italic statements present our beliefs and explain how they are embraced in this book. </p> <p> <b><i>The best learning occurs when the learner actively participates in the process, which includes having ownership in both the process and the product of the learning.</i></b> Consequently, this book is designed to engage you in hands-on and minds-on learning about effective teaching. For example, rather than simply reading a chapter devoted to the important topic of cooperative learning, in each chapter you will become involved in cooperative and collaborative learning. In essence, via the exercises found in every chapter and on the Companion Website, you will practice cooperative learning, talk about it, practice it some more, and finally, through the process of doing it, learn a great deal about it. This book <i>involves</i> you in it. </p> <p> <b><i>The best strategies for learning about secondary school teaching are those that model the strategies used in exemplary teaching of adolescents.</i></b> As you will learn, integrated learning is the cornerstone of effective teaching for the twenty-first century, and that is a premise upon which this text is designed. </p> <p> <b><i>To be most effective a teacher must use an eclectic style in teaching.</i></b> Rather than focus your attention on particular models of teaching, we emphasize the importance of an eclectic model&#x2014;that is, one in which you select and integrate the best from various instructional approaches. For example, sometimes you will want to use a direct, expository approach, perhaps by lecturing; more often you will want to use an indirect, social-interactive, or student-centered approach, perhaps through project-based learning. This book provides guidelines to help you not only decide which approach to use at a particular time but also develop your skill in using specific approaches. </p> <p> <b><i>Learning should be active, pleasant, fun, meaningful; and productive.</i></b> Our desire is to present this book in an enthusiastic, positive, and cognitive-humanistic way, in part by providing rich experiences in social-interactive learning. How this is done is perhaps best exemplified by the active learning exercises found throughout the book and on the Companion Website at <b>www.prenhall.com/kellough</b>. Exercises were developed to ensure that you become an active participant in learning the methods and procedures that are most appropriate in facilitating the learning of active, responsive secondary school students. </p> <p> <b><i>Teaching skills can be learned.</i></b> In medicine, certain knowledge and skills must be learned and developed before the student physician is licensed to practice with patients. In law, certain knowledge and skills must be learned and developed before the law student is licensed to practice with clients. So it is in teacher preparation: knowledge and skills must be learned and developed before the teacher candidate is licensed to practice the art and science of teaching young people. We would never allow just any person to treat our child's illness or to defend us in a legal case; the professional education of teachers is no less important! Receiving a professional education on how to teach young people is absolutely necessary, and certain aspects of that education must precede any interaction with students if teachers are to become truly competent professionals. </p> <p><b>ORGANIZATION OF THIS BOOK: AN OVERVIEW</b></p> <p> Competent secondary school teaching is a kaleidoscopic, multifaceted, eclectic process. When preparing and writing a book for use in teacher preparation, by necessity one must separate that kaleidoscopic process into separate parts, which is not always possible to do in a way that makes the most sense to everyone using the book. We believe that <b><i>there are developmental components involved in becoming a competent teacher.</i></b> This book is organized around four developmental components: <i>why</i>&#x2014;the rationale to support the components that follow; <i>what</i>&#x2014;the content, processes, and skills you will be teaching; <i>how</i>&#x2014;how you will do it; and <i>how well</i>&#x2014;how well you are doing it. These are represented by the four parts of the book. Each part is introduced with the goals of the chapters that follow and with reflective thoughts relevant to topics addressed in its chapters. The visual map on this page illustrates how these four developmental elements are divided. Each chapter begins with a brief introduction to that chapter followed by its major learning targets or objectives. </p> <p> Throughout, we provide information useful for the teacher as a decision-maker. You will find exercises for practicing the handling of concepts in ways that facilitate metacognitive thinking. All exercises, whether included in the text or on the Companion Website, require you to deal in some descriptive, analytical, or self-reflective manner with text concepts and actual practice. Most of the exercises are adaptable for cooperative/collaborative group processing. </p> <p><b>PART I: ORIENTATION TO TEACHING AND LEARNING IN TODAY'S SECONDARY SCHOOLS</b></p> <p> The three chapters of Part I reflect the why component, the reality and challenge of secondary school teaching today. </p> <p> Chapter 1 presents an overview of that reality and challenge. Chapter 2 focuses on the unique and varied characteristics and developmentally appropriate ways of working with secondary school students. <b><i>Regardless of their individual differences, all students must have equal opportunity to participate and learn in the classroom.</i></b> Beginning in the first chapter, this belief is reflected throughout this book, sometimes in a very direct fashion and other times indirectly. This attention to diversity is intended to model not only our belief but also how to be inclusive to people of diverse backgrounds in many ways. </p> <p> Chapter 3 reflects the expectations, responsibilities, and behaviors that are characteristic of competent secondary school teachers. </p> <p><b>PART II: PLANNING FOR INSTRUCTION</b></p> <p> <b><i>Effective teaching is performance based and criterion referenced.</i></b> Our book is constructed in this manner. Because we believe that teaching&#x2014;indeed living&#x2014;must allow for serendipity, encourage the intuitive, and foster the most creative aspects of one's thinking, we cannot always be specific about what students will learn as a result of our instruction, and hence the occasional ambiguity must be expected. The three chapters of Part II reflect the planning, or <i>what,</i> component. </p> <p> To teach adolescents effectively, you must recognize, appreciate, and understand your students and be able to establish and maintain a safe and supportive classroom learning environment. Guidelines for accomplishing that are presented in Chapter 4. </p> <p> Chapter 5 provides a focus on curriculum: the rationale for planning and selecting the content of the curriculum; provides information about the national, state, and local documents that provide benchmarks for learning and that guide content selection; and describes preparing goals and learning targets and using them in planning for and assessment of learning. </p> <p> Chapter 6 will occupy much of your time and attention as you use this book to become a competent secondary school teacher. The chapter presents detailed information and step-by-step guidelines for integrating learning, selecting developmentally appropriate learning activities, arid preparing instructional units and lessons. </p> <p><b>PART III: STRATEGIES, AIDS, MEDIA, AND RESOURCES FOR EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION</b></p> <p> Although it is very difficult to predict what secondary school students of toda...</p></p><h2>The Heart of Desire: Keys to the Pleasures of Love</h2><p>How can you keep sexual desire alive over the long term?

Contributors (identified only in the table of contents) are from France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, England, and the United States. The chapters on photo-journalism, the illustrated press, and photography between the world wars are particularly informative, while high-quality illustrations from public and private collections worldwide convey photography's technical and aesthetic development and its ubiquity. Kathleen Collins, Library of Congress<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Arendt and Heidegger</h2><p><p>Theodor Adorno once wrote an essay to "defend Bach against his devotees." In this book Dana Villa does the same for Hannah Arendt, whose sweeping reconceptualization of the nature and value of political action, he argues, has been covered over and domesticated by admirers (including critical theorists, communitarians, and participatory democrats) who had hoped to enlist her in their less radical philosophical or political projects. Against the prevailing "Aristotelian" interpretation of her work, Villa explores Arendt's modernity, and indeed her postmodernity, through the Heideggerian and Nietzschean theme of a break with tradition at the closure of metaphysics.</p><br><p> Villa's book, however, is much more than a mere correction of misinterpretations of a major thinker's work. Rather, he makes a persuasive case for Arendt as <i>the</i> postmodern or postmetaphysical political theorist, the first political theorist to think through the nature of political action after Nietzsche's exposition of the death of God (i.e., the collapse of objective correlates to our ideals, ends, and purposes). After giving an account of Arendt's theory of action and Heidegger's influence on it, Villa shows how Arendt did justice to the Heideggerian and Nietzschean criticism of the metaphysical tradition while avoiding the political conclusions they drew from their critiques. The result is a wide-ranging discussion not only of Arendt and Heidegger, but of Aristotle, Kant, Nietzsche, Habermas, and the entire question of politics after metaphysics.</p></p><p><b>Dana R. Villa</b> is Assistant Professor of Political Science at Amherst College."Finally a book about Arendt and Heidegger that one can read with intellectual benefit-and without embarrassment!... If there is a point to Arendt's distinction between public and private domains and her resistance to forms of indiscriminate publicity, this is surely a place to respect her teaching. Attentive to this point, Villa presents Arendt and Heidegger as thinkers and writers of the first order whose intellectual contributions must be assessed in their integrity (though, of course, not uncritically)."

A lively satiric return to early 90s Manila, seen from both sides of the Filipino American divide.&#x201d; <i><b>Kirkus Reviews</b></i><br><br> Linmark delivers a harrowing tale of love, family, and cultural bewilderment, a sardonically funny and vibrant novel about one man&#x2019;s journey to his past. . . . Linmark&#x2019;s novel reads like a bittersweet love letter to a vast and perplexing nation. This is a story of heritage, sexuality, and self-discovery that is as riveting as its locale is complex.&#x201d; <i><b>Booklist</b></i><br><br> Linmark offers both a meditation on what it means to be Filipino and an exuberant, affectionate, irreverent love letter to the city of Manila from one of its own. . . . Linmark, who like Vince has lived in both Manila and Hawaii, develops a lively and engaging narrative voice as he skillfully juxtaposes these two very different cultures. . . . This is a jaunty, kaleidoscopic novel that amusingly chronicles the many challenges Vince faces moving between cultures. Recommended for readers of lighthearted literary fiction.&#x201d; <i><b>Library Journal</b></i><br><br> At times uproariously funny, . . . Linmark weaves cultural and historical research into his story and employs a nonlinear structure to the narrative, including jumps in time, lists of Philippines travel tips,&#x201d; and postcards to and from Hawaii. . . . Above all, Linmark&#x2019;s writing is literary: heightened, emotional and beautifully crafted. Linmark began as a poet, and pays close attention to rhythm, economy and word choice, even in such a rollicking, gutsy story. It is a story that many people can relate to, but one that can only be told by a writer of his caliber.&#x201d; <i><b>Honolulu Star Advertiser</b></i><br><br> The story examines culture-shock, modern-day gay life and the way things were in the early &#x2019;90s, all with Linmark&#x2019;s sense of funny. Only this time, the narrative is in third person. Embedded within the book is a certain playfulness. Interspersed are Tourist Tips&#x201d; for Manila, as well as postcards with photos that Vince writes to his friends back home. In short, <i>Leche</i> is all we&#x2019;ve anticipated from Linmark.&#x201d; <i><b>Honolulu Weekly</b></i><br><br> A whirlwind, whistle stop tour of Manila&#x2019;s high society, celebrity pop culture and seedy underbelly. . .&#x201d; <i><b>Bookmunch</b></i><br><br> This time around, Linmark uses his trademark po-mo fragmentation for surface texture; it compromises the novel's picaresque forward motion not a whit. This is a language and a Manila that should be familiar to readers of the Asian American canon, and <i>Leche</i> feels like the long-awaited completion of something we didn't know was incomplete.&#x201d; <i><b>Hyphen</b></i><br><br>"R.

Hepburn, British Journal of Aesthetics</i><br><br>"This early aesthetic work of Kant. . . is clearly and simply written and shows a deep understanding of human nature. What emerges from its pages is that far from being a dry-as-dust pedant, Kant was a man of warmth, feeling, and humour, and possessed an acute sensitivity for the different shades of aesthetic experience. The Observations was published in 1761 and this is the first complete translation since 1799. It contains a comprehensive introduction by the translator, as well as notes by him. . . .

In the midst of struggling with his own motives for writing an autobiographical essay, he comes to the revelation that life, after all, has aspects worth remembering even if moments of beauty are bookended by misery. Yet what can be said of human life, of his own life, when his memory is unreliable, his eyesight is failing, and his mood is despairing?</p><p><b>Michel Leiris</b> (1901&#x2013;1990) was a profoundly influential and versatile French intellectual.

Offering you invaluable advice on how to help clients effectively and happily live with their new identities, Lesbian Epiphanies provides solutions to the challenges that women experience in establishing their other-than-heterosexual orientation in a heterosexist society.</li></ul></p><p>"As Karol Jensen's study makes clear, the transition from marriage to lesbian identity signifies a vital kind of individuation, encompassing many layers of self-experience, not simply sexual. Jensen's lucid writing brings to life the changes these women experience, adding a vital (and neglected) piece to the story of contemporary women's lives. Her work offers both insight and analysis that will be helpful to psychotherapists, women's studies' scholars, and any woman interested in this transition. -- <i>Beverly Burch, PhD, private practice; author, <i>Other Women: Lesbian Bisexual Experience &amp; Psychoanalytic Views of Women</i></i><br><br>"This book not only fills a notable gap in our understanding of those women who come out as lesbians later in life, but also makes a highly significant contribution to theories of sexual orientation development. The interweaving of these women's stories, sexuality theories, and feminism is an exciting and rewarding approach to research in women's and gender studies." -- <i>Michael W.

In the following months, another eight bodies were discovered, all of them those of drug addicts and prostitutes who had worked Spokane's red-light district.</p><p>The police wouldn't even use the term "serial killer." The local media and town leaders also stayed quiet. As long as the victims came from the wrong side of town, "respectable" Spokane didn't seem too worried that a brutal psychopath was in their midst and that as many as eighteen women were dead by his hand.</p><p>Enter Mark Fuhrman.</p><p>A brilliant investigator, Fuhrman helped authorities bring charges against a well-connected suspect when his bestselling book <em>Murder in Greenwich</em> spawned a Connecticut grand jury investigation of the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley. After moving to Idaho, he began appearing as a guest host on a Spokane radio talk show and quickly found himself at the center of another high-profile murder case.</p><p>Written in the same fast-paced style as <em>Murder in Brentwood</em> and <em>Murder in Greenwich,</em> this is a shocking account of Fuhrman's investigation of the prostitutes' deaths as he worked alongside the Spokane Task Force.</p><p>The serial killer preyed on prostitutes with drug problems. He intentionally selected street people, who would not be missed right away, often women who were new to town. The police seemingly put these murders on the back burner because the victims did not stir up public sentiment. Only after the serial killer began to play with the police -- planting bodies for attention and escalating the murders -- did intense effort go into the case.</p><p>Though the understaffed police force did catch the killer, Fuhrman shows that their reliance on computers and on DNA test results from everyone they interviewed was slower than doing old-fashioned gumshoe detective work. With the clues they had, Fuhrman writes, the police could have made the arrest two years earlier -- saving the lives of at least nine women.</p><p>With the expertise of a seasoned investigator and an exceptional writer, Fuhrman takes you inside the mind of a detective pursuing the most dangerous criminal on the streetsa serial killer.</p></p><p>A serial killer is the most elusive prey a homicide detective ever tries to catch. Cunning and obsessed, the serial killer is a psychopath who gets better at what he does each time he kills and learns how to dominate and control not only his victims, but the police, the media, and the public. But in the city of Spokane, Washington, as many as 10 prostitutes had been murdered and dumped in public places over the course of a decade without the public, the local media, or the police force even raising an eyebrow. Then, in August of 1997, two bodies were discovered in separate locations on the same day, and finally the city--with the coaxing of detective turned radio talk-show host Mark Fuhrman--had to take notice. <p> Fuhrman, whose name became infamous during the trial of O.J. Simpson, is a man who cannot leave detective work behind despite having left the police force. The Spokane murders took place a mere 90 miles from his home, and soon he was a regular on a local talk show, analyzing the police task force, the evidence, and the killer, and working the case as if it were his own. Fuhrman takes the reader into the mind of a serial killer as he mulls over the meaning of the bodies found the day after Christmas, the plastic bags over the victims' heads, their missing socks and shoes. Meanwhile, the insular and tight-lipped police task force ignores important clues while more women disappear and then turn up brutally murdered. While there is no secret to how this story turns out, Fuhrman's take on the investigation is hard-hitting, and his portrayal of serial killers destroys any mystique they may have. With this third book, Fuhrman firmly establishes himself as both a sharp detective and a very capable crime writer, with the ability to shed light on the dark world of murder and the law, and a commitment to tell the truth whatever the consequences. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p><p>Retired LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Murder in Brentwood</em>, <em>Murder in Greenwich</em>, <em>Murder in Spokane</em>, and <em>Death and Justice</em>.

These works are often produced by collectives or come out of a community context; they emphasize participation, dialogue, and action, and appear in situations ranging from theater to activism to urban planning to visual art to health care. Engaged with the texture of living, these art works often blur the line between art and life.

Through Maloof&#x2019;s engaging, conversational style, each essay offers a lesson in stewardship as it explores the interwoven connections between a tree species and the animals and insects whose lives depend on it--and who, in turn, work to ensure the tree&#x2019;s survival.<p>Never really at home in a laboratory, Maloof took to the woods early in her career. Her enthusiasm for firsthand observation in the wild spills over into her writing, whether the subject is the composition of forest air, the eagle&#x2019;s preference for nesting in loblolly pines, the growth rings of the bald cypress, or the gray squirrel&#x2019;s fondness for weevil-infested acorns. With a storyteller&#x2019;s instinct for intriguing particulars, Maloof expands our notions about what a tree is&#x201d; through her many asides--about the six species of leafhoppers who eat only sycamore leaves or the midges who live inside holly berries and somehow prevent them from turning red.</p><p>As a scientist, Maloof accepts that trees have a spiritual dimension that cannot be quantified. As an unrepentant tree hugger, she finds support in the scientific case for biodiversity. As an activist, she can&#x2019;t help but wonder how much time is left for our forests.</p></p><p>Joan Maloof teaches biology and environmental studies at Salisbury University in Salisbury, Maryland."Walk along with Joan Maloof through a forest, and you will see, hear, and smell stories better than anything on the Discovery Channel or, for that matter, in the Brothers Grimm.

Wright Mills: Letters and Autobiographical Writings</h2><p>One of the leading public intellectuals of twentieth-century America and a pioneering and brilliant social scientist, C. Wright Mills left a legacy of interdisciplinary and hard-hitting work including two books that changed the way many people viewed their lives and the structure of power in the United States: <i>White Collar</i> (1951) and <i>The Power Elite</i> (1956). Mills persistently challenged the status quo within his profession--as in <i>The Sociological Imagination</i> (1959)--and within his country, until his untimely death in 1962. This collection of letters and writings, edited by his daughters, allows readers to see behind Mills's public persona for the first time.<br><br> Mills's letters to prominent figures--including Saul Alinsky, Daniel Bell, Lewis Coser, Carlos Fuentes, Hans Gerth, Irving Howe, Dwight MacDonald, Robert K. Merton, Ralph Miliband, William Miller, David Riesman, and Harvey Swados--are joined by his letters to family members, letter-essays to an imaginary friend in Russia, personal narratives by his daughters, and annotations drawing on published and unpublished material, including the FBI file on Mills.</p><p>"The extraordinary C. Wright Mills was an intellectual hero of the New Left, a model of the engaged academic. This volume of his letters and writings provides a fascinating insight into Mills as a person as a family man and a friend as well as a thinker. Mills packed so much into his terribly short life, and young people today should find inspiration in his enormous energy, his breadth of interest, and his political boldness."

Much of this is due to the fact that two new co-authors have been added to the text. As the first author, I feel profoundly blessed to have two gifted and caring family nurses join me in updating and enriching the fifth edition's content and presentation. Dr. Vicky Bowden is a well-known nursing author, practitioner, and educator. Dr. Elaine Jones is also very experienced and expert in family nursing education, practice, and research with families with deaf members. Their positive contributions have made revising this text an exciting and very positive endeavor. We each revised about one third of the chapters, but carefully reviewed and made suggestions to the primary revisor on the other chapters to make them more comprehensive and relevant. </p> <p> Great strides have been made in the field of family nursing since this text's inception in 1980 and the additions and changes in this text parallel family nursing's growth. There has been a proliferation of texts in family nursing that contain in-depth discussions of theories, research, and practice. The increase in publications about family nursing; the inception of the <i>Journal of Family Nursing</i> in 1995; the growing incorporation of family nursing into ANA Standards of Nursing Practice, NANDA nursing diagnoses, and the Nursing Intervention Classification (NIC); the holding of national and international family nursing conferences; the continuing activity of the family and health section of the National Council for Family Relations; and the increase in family nursing courses and content in both undergraduate and graduate nursing programs present strong evidence of the development of family nursing as both an integral part of generalist practice and as a specialty area in advanced practice nursing. Moreover, there is a growing consensus that family nursing is conceptually and empirically distinct from nursing of family members. And due to the profound influence of family therapy and the application of systems theory, family nurses are increasingly "thinking interactionally" in their writings and conversations about families and family nursing practice. </p> <p> The text's focus in the fifth edition includes nursing diagnoses and interventions. In this edition, as previous editions, the same basic comprehensive family assessment tool is presented, with some modification. The family assessment model is based primarily on three theoretical perspectives: a systems perspective, a structural-functional perspective, and a family developmental perspective. A multicultural perspective is also integrated throughout. </p> <p> This text is intended for undergraduate and graduate family nursing students and practitioners who are not practicing advanced family therapy or family systems nursing. Advanced family nursing practice requires the completion of a specialized program at the master's level. Hence, we included family nursing interventions that are basic and straightforward; these suggested interventions, although certainly necessary within family nursing practice, are insufficient for working with the very complex family in which more sophisticated, indirect interviewing and advanced counseling skills are required. </p> <p><b>NEW FEATURES IN THE FIFTH EDITION</b></p> <p> In the fifth edition of this text, the following new features have been added: </p> <ul> <li>Content outlines have been added at the beginning of each chapter.</li> <li>A bulleted summary at the end of each chapter highlights the key ideas within the chapter.</li> <li>A glossary containing the major terms used in each of the chapters augments comprehension.</li> <li>More tables and figures have been added to graphically depict key points.</li> <li>As part of the review questions at the end of each chapter, a family vignette has been added, which addresses chapter content and augments critical thinking skills.</li> <li>Chapters addressing practice areas include family assessment, family diagnoses, and family nursing interventions.</li> <li>In the family nursing practice chapters, three variables are considered: gender differences, sociocultural variation, and differences created by health alterations.</li> <li>Statistics and references have been carefully updated.</li> <li>The latest NANDA (North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) and NIC (Nursing Interventions Classification) descriptions are incorporated.</li> </ul> <p><b>CONTENT NEW TO THE FIFTH EDITION</b></p> <p> This book is subdivided into four broad sections. Part I includes two introductory chapters that discuss the family's importance and family definitions (Chapter 1) and family nursing's evolution, focus, and goals (Chapter 2). In Chapter 1, the sections outlining demographic trends impacting the family and the varied family forms have been updated and enlarged. The chapter on family nursing (Chapter 2) covers the gamut of emerging goals and roles of the family nurse from health promotion through rehabilitation. The rising costs of medical care; the implementation of managed care; the rising proportion of older, chronically ill individuals; and the recognition that many chronic illnesses can be prevented or ameliorated with lifestyle changes are prominent trends that have greatly expanded the role of the family nurse in both health promotion and acute and long-term care. Several major current issues facing family nursing facilitate our understanding of the status of family nursing today. </p> <p> Part II addresses the basic theoretical foundations of family nursing (Chapters 3 through 6) . Chapter 3, "Theoretical Foundations of Family Nursing," reviews the various theories used in family nursing practice, with much better coverage of nursing theories than in the previous edition. Integrated family nursing theories are also described and advocated. Chapter 4 is a short chapter describing structural-functional theory and how it has been applied in this text. Chapter 5, "Family Developmental Theory" has been revised and updated to include a broader range of developmental theories. In this chapter, family developmental theory is applied to single-parent and stepparent families, in addition to the two-parent nuclear family. Chapter 6, "Systems Theory," contains greater coverage of holism, cybernetics, and communication theory as more focused, midrange theories subsumed under general systems theory. </p> <p> Part III introduces the reader to the family nursing process as well as the actual family assessment model or tool (located within each of the individual chapters), family nursing diagnoses, and family nursing interventions. Chapter 7, "The Family Nursing Process," has been updated and revised, combining two chapters from the previous edition of the text into one chapter that is more comprehensive and includes a very thorough discussion of family nursing interventions. Chapter 7 covers the new literature appearing in the counseling, education, case management, and family nursing process areas. Chapter 8, "Family Identifying Data: Sociocultural Assessment and Intervention," discusses family nursing in the context of sociocultural diversity. Updating of statistical data and literature on the significant demographic changes taking place in America provide a greater understanding about the urgency of practicing competently with families from diverse backgrounds. </p> <p> In the remainder of the practice chapters (Chapters 9 through 16) pertinent research, theory, and practice implications have been incorporated. These chapters address family structural dimensions; family functions; and family stress, coping, and adaptation. Family structural dimensions are crucial to family nursing practice, since they cover family dynamics as seen in family communication patterns and processes (Chapter 10), family power and decision making (Chapter 11), the family role structure (Chapter 12), and family values (Chapter 13). The affective function (Chapter 14), family socialization function (Chapter 15), and the health care function (Chapter 16) are the three most relevant family functions to assess in family nursing. Family stress, coping processes, and adaptation (Chapter 17) are also essential components within family nursing assessment and intervention. </p> <p> Chapter 9, "Family Environmental Data," has new sections on resources in the home (such as Internet access), discussion of differences in rural versus urban family environment, an updated section on the effects of homelessness on family health, and a new section focusing on the sociopolitical environment as an important factor in family health. </p> <p> Chapter 10, "Family Communication Patterns and Processes," contains both classic and recent research and theoretical content related to functional and dysfunctional family communication patterns. This chapter also discusses the influence of cultural beliefs, family life cycle stage, gender, family form, and family mini-culture on- family communication patterns. </p> <p> Chapter 11, "Family Power and Decision Making," presents foundational concepts in family power. Discussion of family violence is now included in this chapter, with specific sections addressing intimate partner abuse, child and adolescent abuse, sibling abuse, parent abuse, and elder abuse. </p> <p> Chapter 12, "Family Role Structure," focuses on research on family role changes during illness, with an expanded discussion about the family caregiver role, and the role of the father in contemporary families. A particular strength is the expanded section about grandparents' roles in families, especially grandmothers who are involved in raising grandchildren. </p> <p> Chapter 13, "Family Values," contains new information regarding changes in family values that have emerged in recent years as a result of societal changes. Disparities in value systems are discussed, especially those that exist between the family and the health care professional. </p> <p> Chapter 14, "The Family Affective Function," reviews essential components of the affective function. The chapter covers the process of family bereavement more thoroughly than in the previous editions. </p> <p> In Chapter 15, "The Family Socialization Function," findings are incorporated from the latest socialization research. There is also broadened coverage of multicultural aspects of parenting, and unique socialization issues for single-parent families, stepparent families, and families with gay or lesbian parents. </p> <p> In Chapter 16, "The Family Health Care Function," the critical thrust of family health promotion is clearly evident, with Pender's revised Health Promotion Model providing the theoretical foundation for identifying the multiple factors influencing family health promotion. Recent research findings on health care practices among families, such as lifestyle practices and the use of medically based and alternative/complementary health care, have also been incorporated. </p> <p> A major revamping of the content within Chapter 17, now titled "Family Stress, Coping, and Adaptation" occurred. The Resiliency Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation is fully described, and other research and theoretical developments in the area of family stress and coping have been updated. Family resiliency, family coherence, and factors influencing coping are emphasized. In addition, social support research, theory, and clinical application have been added to this chapter. </p> <p> In Part IV (Chapters 18, 19, and 20), cultural differences among families from the three largest minority groups in the United States, Latino, African-American, and Asian-American, are addressed. Current literature about each of these families, coupled with an expanded description of family nursing assessment and interventions that are culturally sensitive and appropriate, make these chapters quite useful for working with culturally diverse clients. Chapter 20, "The Asian-American Family," was a new chapter in the fourth edition, and is a reflection of the growing presence of Asian-Americans in the United States today. Their Eastern legacy is so disparate from our Western tradition that family nurses who work with traditional Asian-Americans need to be sensitive to these profound cultural differences. </p> <p> The Appendices contain the Friedman Family Assessment Model (long form and short form), a family case description and the use of the family nursing process in the case example, as well as answers to the family vignettes and study questions. The family nursing example is included to give students a concrete model of family nursing practice and also an opportunity to retest themselves on the use of the Friedman Family Assessment Model and application of the family nursing process. Chapters in Part III describe the knowledge base needed to complete the family assessment and to develop family nursing diagnoses and intervention guidelines. </p> <p><b>THE NEW EDITION: A REFLECTION OF EXPANDED VISTAS IN FAMILY NURSING</b></p> <p> Our ardent belief is that health professionals, regardless of the setting, must broaden their commitment so that they serve families as units, as well as family subsystems (e.g., parental subsystems) and individual family members. It is well recognized that a considerable gap exists between the ideal (what ought to be) and the real (the actual practice of nursing today). In spite of nursing's and health care's shortcomings, family nursing continues to be a very exciting and rewarding dimension of professional nursing, as well as an emerging, vital, advanced practice nursing area. We hope this text is able to convey some of our excitement about family nursing to you, as well as give you the foundations to practice more comfortably and effectively with families. Happy reading! </p> <p> &#x2014; <i>Marilyn M.

Since then the movement has been analyzed and over-analyzed, declared triumphant and, more than once, given up for dead. But because outside observers have maintained a near-relentless focus on domestic politics, the most transformative development over the last several decades--the explosive growth of Christianity in the global south--has gone unrecognized by the wider public, even as it has transformed evangelical life, both in the US and abroad. <br><br><em>The Kingdom of God Has No Borders</em> offers a daring new perspective on conservative Christianity by shifting the lens to focus on the world outside US borders. Melani McAlister offers a sweeping narrative of the last fifty years of evangelical history, weaving a fascinating tale that upends much of what we know--or think we know--about American evangelicals. She takes us to the Congo in the 1960s, where Christians were enmeshed in a complicated interplay of missionary zeal, Cold War politics, racial hierarchy, and anti-colonial struggle. She shows us how evangelical efforts to convert non-Christians have placed them in direct conflict with Islam at flash points across the globe. And she examines how Christian leaders have fought to stem the tide of HIV/AIDS in Africa while at the same time supporting harsh repression of LGBTQ communities.<br><br>Through these and other stories, McAlister focuses on the many ways in which looking at evangelicals abroad complicates conventional ideas about evangelicalism. We can't truly understand how conservative Christians see themselves and their place in the world unless we look beyond our shores.<br></p><p><br><strong>Melani McAlister</strong> teaches American Studies and International Affairs at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.

In the course of her travels she has dined, not always eagerly, on wild rat, parrot, guinea pig, and chicken foot soup. And for those among us who prefer our experiences to be vicarious and far away from biting insects, venomous snakes, and inhospitable surroundings, she has written <i>In Search of the Golden Frog</i>.<br><br>The book is a detailed and fascinating chronicle of Crump's adventures as a field biologist&#x2014;and as a wife and mother&#x2014;in South and Central America. Following Crump on her research trips through Costa Rica, Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, we learn of amazingly diverse landscapes, equally diverse national traditions and customs, and the natural history of her subject of study, the frog.

Her memoir, begun as a gift for her children, is now a treat for anyone with a taste for travel, nature, and a story well told.<p> Crump's tone is always friendly, never pompous, and the vivid details provide for the best sort of armchair travel, where you can almost (but happily, not quite) feel the oppressive humidity, taste the decayed banana wine, and smell the fetid vegetation, while picturing the astonishing glories of "over one hundred Day-Glo golden orange toads poised like statues, dazzling jewels against the dark brown mud."</p><p> She juggled the rigors of fieldwork with the demands of motherhood, learning to express milk for her 6-week-old infant Karen while hiking in the rain to study frogs in the lush mountains of Costa Rica. Her field experience has certainly contributed to her herpetological expertise (not for nothing was she honored with the Distinguished Herpetologist Award), but it has also created a bountiful supply of exceptional travel stories.

As a result it boasts a rich and diverse avifauna, including some of the most spectacular and fascinating birds to be found anywhere in the world. John MacKinnon and Karen Phillipps' important new guide will be the first truly comprehensive, taxonomically modern, and fully illustrated field guide to the birds of China. Over 1300 bird species are illustrated in 128 original colour paintings, by Karen Phillipps and Dave Showler. The species accounts stress the key points for field recognition and give a full description of the plumage, voice, range, distribution, status, and behavioral characteristics for every bird, with additional descriptions provided for hundreds of subspecies. Colour distribution maps are provided for all illustrated species. The book also includes a useful introductory section that presents a background to the ecology of China, a brief history of Chinese ornithology, and plenty of practical hints on birdwatching in China. The guide's portable format means it will fit easily into a backpack or pocket. John MacKinnon lived in China and Hong Kong for eight years, and has extensive experience of watching and writing about Chinese birds. He has been working in ecology and conservation in Asia for over 30 years, and his work in China included co-authoring the master plan to save the Giant Panda and its habitat. He has written and co-authored many books on the natural history of Asia, including a number of other bird guides. Karen Phillipps was born in Borneo, lived in Hong Kong for over 20 years, and has illustrated several other books on the birdlife of the region.<br></p><p><br><strong>John MacKinnon</strong> is Professor of Biodiversity Information at the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology at the University of Kent in Canterbury, England. He is currently posted in the Philippines as head of a European Union project to set up an ASEAN Regional Centre for Biodiversity Conservation. He is Chairman of a Special Biodiversity Working Group that advises the Chinese Government on biodiversity matters, and formerly spent eight years living in China and Hong Kong working on a number of conservation projects in China. Apart from many technical reports on China he has published two other books on the country - <em>Wild China</em> and <em>A Photoguide to the Birds of China</em>. Among several other books on natural history of Asia, he is also the senior author of <em>A Field Guide to the Birds of Borneo, Sumatra, Java and Bali</em> which remains the standard bird guide to the Greater Sunda Islands.<br><br>"This field guide has been long awaited by the growing number of birders visiting China. By including in one volume all the species--complete with distribution maps--recorded in this vast country, it represents a huge step forward. It is the first complete, taxonomically up-to-date and fully illustrated guide to the birds of China published in English ... The initial chapters include an introduction to the region, with a revealing section on birds in the local economy and culture. ... Next come the 128 all-important colour plates, which have distribution maps opposite--an arrangement which I like. ... The species accounts cover nomenclature, descriptions, voice, range (global), distribution and status (within region) and habits, and occupy 500 pages. Finally, there are appendices which include lists of endangered and protected species, and endemic and limited-distribution species. ... This book is a major achievement and an invaluable conservation tool."--<em>Birdwatch</em><p></p><br>"This field guide is a great step forward and essential for anyone with an interest in China's birds. For the first time, in any language, all China's 1329 species are described and illustrated in one book and despite containing more than 500 pages its A5 size makes it compact enough for easy field use. The layout is well thought out...it is easy to identify which similar species should be present in a particular region of China. It is well worth the price of the book just to have all species illustrated accurately. Overall a good quality field guide that I would not be without." -- <em>Ross</em> <em>MacLeod, British Ornithologists' Union, Vol 143, 2001</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Research Methods in Human-Computer Interaction</h2><p><b>A comprehensive research guide for both quantitative and qualitative research methods</b> <p>Written by a team of authorities in human-computer interaction (HCI) and usability, this pedagogical guide walks you through the methods used in HCI and examines what are considered to be appropriate research practices in the field.

Why turn such important matters over to masses of people who have no expertise? Many theories of democracy answer by appealing to the intrinsic value of democratic procedure, leaving aside whether it makes good decisions. In <i>Democratic Authority</i>, David Estlund offers a groundbreaking alternative based on the idea that democratic authority and legitimacy must depend partly on democracy's tendency to make good decisions.</p><br><p> Just as with verdicts in jury trials, Estlund argues, the authority and legitimacy of a political decision does not depend on the particular decision being good or correct. But the "epistemic value" of the procedure--the degree to which it can generally be accepted as tending toward a good decision--is nevertheless crucial. Yet if good decisions were all that mattered, one might wonder why those who know best shouldn't simply rule.</p><br><p> Estlund's theory--which he calls "epistemic proceduralism"--avoids epistocracy, or the rule of those who know. He argues that while some few people probably do know best, this can be used in political justification only if their expertise is acceptable from all reasonable points of view. If we seek the best epistemic arrangement in this respect, it will be recognizably democratic--with laws and policies actually authorized by the people subject to them.</p></p><p><p>"A brilliant book, and indispensable reading for anyone interested in democratic theory. Estlund's careful treatment of the 'wisdom of crowds' and the idea of deliberative democracy stands out as a particularly large advance. One of the very few truly major contributions to democratic theory in the last quarter century."<b>--Cass R. Sunstein, Harvard Law School</b></p><p>"David Estlund defends democracy for its ability to make good decisions without handing things over to experts. This book is original, imaginative, and filled with subtle and compelling philosophical argument. A wonderful book, and an important one."<b>--Joshua Cohen, Stanford University</b></p><p>"This book breaks new ground, developing an overall view of democratic procedure, in particular of its legitimacy, that really has no precedent in the literature. It will stand as the canonical defense of epistemic proceduralism."<b>--Philip Pettit, Princeton University</b></p><p>"David Estlund's book is original, ambitious, thoughtful, and thought-provoking. It is an important and philosophically nuanced contribution to democratic theory."<b>--Christian List, London School of Economics and Political Science</b></p><b>David M.

Parrillo experienced multiculturalism early as the son of a second-generation Italian American father and Irish/German American mother. He grew up in an ethnically diverse neighborhood, developing friendships and teenage romances with second- and third-generation Dutch, German, Italian, and Polish Americans. As he grew older, he developed other friendships that frequently crossed racial and religious lines.</p> <p>Professor Parrillo came to the field of sociology after first completing a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in business management and a master&#x2019;s degree in English.

With his fleet of hundreds of junks, he traveled from Southeast Asia to Africa, from India to the Middle East, gathering riches, scientific knowledge, fame, and power for his emperor. He came close to conquering the world, until the Ming Dynasty's power shriveled and the explorer's accomplishments were all but forgotten. More than six centuries after his first voyage, acclaimed photographer Michael Yamashita restores the deeds of the "Forgotten Admiral" to their rightful place in history. In this compelling tribute to Zheng He, Yamashita traces each of his journeys and pays homage to the impressive achievements of this explorer whose feats equal or surpass those of other better-known explorers. In a meticulous visual recreation that has become his signature style, Yamashita presents the details of each voyage, chronicling the interactions and commercial exchanges, and documenting, through his exceptional photographs, the diverse locales <i>Zheng He</i> discovered in nearly three decades of intense exploration.</p><p><b>Michael Yamashita</b> has combined his two passions&#x2014;photography and travel&#x2014;as a regular contributor to <i>National Geographic</i> since 1979. He has received numerous awards, including the National Press Photographers Association Pictures of the Year Competition, and an award from the New York Art Director's Club. He is the author of Marco Polo (White Star, 2005). <b>Gianni Guadalupi</b> has worked for many years compiling anthologies on literature pertaining to travel. He has written numerous books on the culture of travel for White Star.Mixing ancient Chinese prints and vivid color photographs, Yamashita retraces forgotten journeys of Ming Dynasty explorer Zheng He, reputed to have reached the Americas 70 years before Christopher Columbus and other Europeans. Following Zheng's seven voyages, Yamashita traveled from the South China Sea to the Swahili coast of east Africa and the Middle East, capturing vestiges of Zheng He's world in contemporary Asia. Best suited to serious readers, the historical background contributed by Gianni Guadalupi along with Yamashita's introductions to each series of photographs clarify the connections between the two. <i>(Oct. 17)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It traces this evolution from late Egyptian religion and the revelations of Zoroaster and the Orphics in antiquity through the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Mithraic Mysteries, and the great Gnostic teachers to its revival in medieval Europe with the suppression of the Bogomils and the Cathars, heirs to the age-long teachings of dualism.

Illustrated by Hugh Thomson</p><p>Though Jane Austen was writing at a time when Gothic potboilers such as Ann Ward Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i> and Horace Walpole's <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> were all the rage, she never got carried away by romance in her own novels. In Austen's ordered world, the passions that ruled Gothic fiction would be horridly out of place; marriage was, first and foremost, a contract, the bedrock of polite society. Certain rules applied to who was eligible and who was not, how one courted and married and what one expected afterwards. To flout these rules was to tear at the basic fabric of society, and the consequences could be terrible. Each of the six novels she completed in her lifetime are, in effect, comic cautionary tales that end happily for those characters who play by the rules and badly for those who don't. In <i>Mansfield Park</i>, for example, Austen gives us Fanny Price, a poor young woman who has grown up in her wealthy relatives' household without ever being accepted as an equal. The only one who has truly been kind to Fanny is Edmund Bertram, the younger of the family's two sons. <p> Into this Cinderella existence comes Henry Crawford and his sister, Mary, who are visiting relatives in the neighborhood. Soon Mansfield Park is given over to all kinds of gaiety, including a daring interlude spent dabbling in theatricals. Young Edmund is smitten with Mary, and Henry Crawford woos Fanny. Yet these two charming, gifted, and attractive siblings gradually reveal themselves to be lacking in one essential Austenian quality: principle. Without good principles to temper passion, the results can be disastrous, and indeed, <i>Mansfield Park</i> is rife with adultery, betrayal, social ruin, and ruptured friendships. But this <i>is</i> a comedy, after all, so there is also a requisite happy ending and plenty of Austen's patented gentle satire along the way. Describing the switch in Edmund's affections from Mary to Fanny, she writes: "I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that everyone may be at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable passions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as to time in different people." What does <i>not</i> vary is the pleasure with which new generations come to Jane Austen. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>In recent years, Mansfield Park has come to be regarded as Austen&#39;s most controversial novel. It was published in two editions in her lifetime and here the differences between the first edition and the second, including some important amendments made by Jane Austen herself, are clearly noted on the page. The volume provides comprehensive notes, an extensive critical introduction covering the context and publication history of the work, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual appa ratus. This edition is indispensable for all serious scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>NIV, The MacArthur Study Bible, Leathersoft, Brown: Holy Bible, New International Version</h2><p><p>"John MacArthur is, considered one of the top Biblical scholars living today.

The abbreviation of this empire is called a consumer culture. </p><p>We think the free market ideology that surrounds us is true and inevitable and represents progress. We are called to better adapt, be more agile, more lean, more schooled, more, more, more. Give it up. There is no such thing as customer satisfaction. </p><p>We need a new narrative, a shift in our thinking and speaking. <i>An Other Kingdom</i> takes us out of a culture of addictive consumption into a place where life is ours to create together. &nbsp;This satisfying way depends upon a neighborly covenant&#x2015;an agreement that we together, will better raise our children, be healthy, be connected, be safe, and provide a livelihood. The neighborly covenant has a different language than market-hype. It speaks instead in a sacred tongue. </p><p>Authors Peter Block, Walter Brueggemann, and John McKnight invite you on a journey of departure from our consumer market culture, with its constellations of empire and control.

They ask you to consider this other kingdom. To participate in this modern exodus towards a modern community.

Lebensztejn is one of France&#x2019;s best-kept secrets. A world-class art historian who has lectured and taught at major universities in the United States, his work has remained almost entirely in French, his American audience limited to a small but dedicated group of cognoscenti. First introducing the Manneken Pis&#x2014;the iconic little boy whose stream of urine supplies water to this famous fountain and is also the logo for a Belgian beer company&#x2014;the author takes the reader through a semi-scatological maze of cultural history. The earliest example is a fresco scene located directly above Cimabue&#x2019;s Crucifixion from around 1280 at the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi, in which Lebensztejn&#x2019;s careful eye locates an angel behind a pillar who looks like he is about to urinate through a hole in his garment. He continues to navigate expertly through cultural twists and turns, stopping to discuss Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x2019;s 1968 film Teorema, for example, and Marlene Dumas&#x2019;s 1996&#x2013;1997 homage to Rembrandt&#x2019;s pissing woman. At every moment, Lebensztejn&#x2019;s prose is lively, his thinking dynamic, and his subject matter entertaining. In this short and poignant cultural history, readers not only find the care for detail that has made Lebensztejn into one of the greatest European art historians, but also the rebelliousness that makes him one of the most interesting intellectuals of our time. The first widely distributed book of Lebensztejn&#x2019;s in English, Pissing Figures 1280&#x2013;2014 is simultaneously published in France by �ditions Macula.</p><p>Jean-Claude Lebensztejn is a French art historian, critic, and honorary professor of the University of Paris 1 Panth�on-Sorbonne. His interests range from the art of the eighteenth and twentieth centuries, to film, music, human animality, and more generally, the question of frontiers and boundaries. In addition to his �tudes c�zanniennes (2006) and a scholarly edition of fifty-three of C�zanne&#x2019;s letters (2011), Lebensztejn has recently published D�placements, a collection of his essays concerned with questioning norms of taste and aesthetic values, as well as a translation of Lao Tzu, a study of Pygmalion, a conversation with Malcolm Morley. His most recent book on transgression in the works of Franz Kafka, Marquis de Sade, and Comte de Lautr�amont was published in 2017.A curious journey through art history and one that&#x2019;s worth the trip. (Hrag Varnatnian <i>Hyperallergic</i>)<br><br>The book, in a rangy, fluent translation from Jeff Nagy, is a record of what Lebensztejn calls our &#x201c;diuretic fantasies&#x201d;&#x2015;of the lore and lust surrounding urine, sacred and profane.

The methods it deals with can easily be followed by engineers, although advanced mathematics is used in the sections on airfoil.<br>Coverage is wide, ranging from an introduction to flow in pipes to Dr. Prandtl's own work on boundary layers, drag, airfoil theory, and experimental methods. Of special interest are discussions of entry conditions for flow in a pipe; turbulent flow in pipes and in the boundary layer; the method of determining the drag of a body from the velocity and pressure of the wake; measurement of pressure drop at the transition between laminar and turbulent flow;&nbsp; the laws of pressure drag, friction drag, and deformation drag; application of the momentum theorem to the K�rm�n trail; experiments with the properties of slotted wings; the airfoil of infinite length; three-dimensional airfoil theory; and experimental methods and apparatus (pressure and velocity measurements, drag measurements, wind tunnels, and visualizing flow phenomena).<br><br></p><p></p><h2>Partnership Income Taxation, 5th (Concepts and Insights)</h2><p>This edition of Lyons and Repetti&#x2019;s Partnership Income Taxation attempts the simplest possible introduction to an intricate body of law.

Therefore, the authors have tried to make the subject accessible, not by paraphrasing the rules, but by including examples that are as straightforward as possible. The authors focus on simple partnerships holding few assets and engaging in routine transactions. They place the rules in context by pointing out the purposes of the Internal Revenue Code provisions and regulations and by presenting background information about practical matters, such as how partnerships maintain capital accounts and how nonrecourse financing works.</p><p></p><h2>Davis&#39;s NCLEX-PN� Review</h2><p><ul><br> <li>NEW!

In this original and daring study, Steven Conn argues that Americans, endowed with the belief that knowledge resided in objects themselves, built these institutions with the confidence that they could collect, organize, and display the sum of the world's knowledge. Conn discovers how museums gave definition to different bodies of knowledge and how these various museums helped to shape America's intellectual history.<br> <br> "Conn is an enthusiastic advocate for his subject, an appealing thinker, an imaginative researcher, a scholar at ease with theory and with empirical evidence." &#x2014;Ann Fabian, <i>Reviews in American History</i><br> <br> "Steven Conn's masterly study of late-nineteenth century American museums transports the reader to a strange and wonderful intellectual universe. . . . At the end of the day, Conn reminds us, objects still have the power to fascinate, attract, evoke, and, in the right context, explain." &#x2014;Christopher Clarke-Hazlett, <i>Journal of American History</i></p></p><p>During the last half of the nineteenth century, many of the country&#39;s most celebrated museums were built.

It includes exercises, chapter summaries, games, diagrams, illustrations, and 4-color reproductions of great works of art. The excellent selection of poetry includes new poets as well as &#34;classics&#34; and the coverage of women poets and minorities has been expanded in this edition.</p><p>Born in Muskegon, Michigan, John Frederick Nims received his M.A. from the University of Notre Dame and his Ph.D. in comparative literature from the University of Chicago.

Set in the prison where Socrates is awaiting execution, it portrays Plato&#39;s model philosopher in action, spending his last hours in conversation with two other seasoned members of his circle about the fate of the human soul after death. Professor Rowe attempts to help the reader find a way through the intricate structure both of individual passages and arguments and of the dialogue as a whole, stressing its intelligibility as a unified work of art and giving equal attention to its literary and philosophical aspects. The notes also aim to provide the kind of help with Plato&#39;s Greek which is needed by comparative beginners in the language, but the commentary is intended for any student, classical scholar, or philosopher with an interest in the close reading of Plato.</p><p>The book is brand new and will be dispatched from UK.Very usable source.

"He wrote for the day, the moment; but these are just the writers whom posterity is apt to put into its pocket." Considered by contemporary critics to be Trollope's greatest novel, The Way We Live Now is a satire of the literary world of London in the 1870s and a bold indictment of the new power of speculative finance in English life. "I was instigated by what I conceived to be the commercial profligacy of the age," Trollope said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; His story concerns Augustus Melmotte, a French swindler and scoundrel, and his daughter, to whom Felix Carbury, adored son of the authoress Lady Carbury, is induced to propose marriage for the sake of securing a fortune. Trollope knew well the difficulties of dealing with editors, publishers, reviewers, and the public; his portrait of Lady Carbury, impetuous, unprincipled, and unswervingly devoted to her own self-promotion, is one of his finest satirical achievements.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; His picture of late nineteenth century England is of a society on the verge of moral bankruptcy, where the traditional virtues of Tory squirearchy, represented by Roger Carbury, prove to be no match for the financial genius of Augustus Melmotte. In The Way We Live Now Trollope combines his talents as a portraitist and his skills as a storyteller to give us life as it was lived more than a hundred years ago.</p><h2>The Secrets of Economic Indicators: Hidden Clues to Future Economic Trends and Investment Opportunities, 2nd Edition</h2><p><p>&#x201c;This is the real deal.

How did you come up with this death wish?"</p> <p>That was the first response I got after telling a colleague at <i>TIME</i> what I was up to. She, too, was a financial journalist, so I expected some sage advice and support. We continued our conversation over lunch. "Did I hear you correctly?" she asked, still incredulous. "We <i>are</i> talking about your writing a book on economic statistics, right?" Yes, I nodded, and then went on to explain why this idea had been percolating in my mind for months. I knew it was a tough topic to write about, but I was ready to take it on. She listened patiently to my reasoning and then let loose a barrage of suggestions.</p> <p>"First, let's get real here. To make this work, a book on economic indicators has to be sexy. Edgy. Really funny. Get in some lurid details about consumer prices. Tell some lascivious tales about industrial production and capacity utilization. Toss in lots of jokes on durable-goods orders. Then there's the humor that just springs at you when writing about foreign trade and nonfarm productivity. And . . . hey, shouldn't you be taking notes on all this?"</p> <p>The appetite I came to the restaurant with was suddenly gone. Not because she was poking fun at the idea. Just the opposite. Beneath all that sarcasm was a genuine message that I knew had to be taken seriously. The subject of economic indicators can be lethally boring because of its impenetrable jargon and reliance on tedious statistics. I realized from that brutal lunch encounter that my biggest challenge in writing this book was not simply to identify and describe the world's most influential economic indicators, but to make the whole subject approachable and even&#x2014;dare I say it&#x2014;interesting. My purpose from the start was to reach out to those who had little or no experience navigating the maze of key economic statistics and to dispel the notion that you need an economics degree, an MBA, or a CPA to understand what these indicators tell us about the economy and how we can use them to make better investment and business decisions.</p> <p>The broader question, of course, is why do this book at all? Why should anyone outside the economics profession even care about economic indicators? Why is it important for the average person to know how many new homes are under construction, whether factories produced more or fewer goods in the latest month, or whether executives charged with buying raw material for their companies are increasing their orders or cutting back? Why bother with any of this stuff? Why not let the experts sort out the mishmash of economic numbers and tell us what it means?</p> <p>Indeed, most Americans have little desire to follow such esoteric measures. They are content to rely on the insights of their investment advisers or hear television pundits muse endlessly about the economy and the financial markets. Other than that, few show interest in probing any further. However, that attitude changed abruptly in 2000 with the bursting of the stock market bubble and the collapse of the dot-com sector. Investors were sickened and then angered by the resulting loss of trillions of dollars in personal wealth. It made no difference whether the money was in one's personal savings, a 401(k), or a pension. No investment escaped unscathed. The decimation was universal, and for Americans, it became a painful and sobering reminder of just how much one's financial well-being was staked to the risky business of stocks and bonds.</p> <p>Perhaps the most troubling revelation to come out of this awful experience was how utterly dependent ordinary investors had allowed themselves to become on so-called "experts" for virtually all investment advice. It turned out that these very "experts"&#x2014; veteran portfolio managers and longtime professional market watchers&#x2014;failed miserably in their responsibility to help protect the assets and curb the losses of their investing clients. Worse still, investors became justifiably furious when they realized they were also being lied to by some of the companies they had invested in and even by the brokerage firms with whom they had entrusted their hard-earned money.</p> <p>The result was predictable. Disillusioned by the ineffectual advice of their brokers, the seemingly endless revelations of corporate fraud, and the biased research reports put out by some well-known Wall Street firms, a growing number of Americans have since decided to venture into the investment world by themselves, trusting their own instincts rather than someone else's. These investors are emboldened by the fact that they can now access a huge assortment of information resources from home and work. They can even access them while traveling. There is, today, an unprecedented abundance of economic and financial news and analysis instantly available to anyone, anytime. This includes virtually 24/7 radio and television coverage of business news and, of course, hundreds of useful Web sites that offer valuable data as well as varied perspectives on the outlook for the financial markets and the economy.</p> <p>How do the economic indicators fit into all this? Why should investors&#x2014;or business executives, entrepreneurs, and ordinary workers&#x2014;pay particular attention to these reports? Because they are the vital barometers that tell us what the economy is up to and, more importantly, in what direction it is likely to go in the future. These indicators describe the economic backdrop that will ultimately affect corporate earnings, interest rates, and inflation. They can also influence the future cost of financing a car or house, the security of our jobs, and our overall standard of living. Even business leaders are under pressure to monitor economic indicators more closely. Knowledge of economic conditions in the U.S. enables CEOs to make decisions with greater confidence about whether to buy more equipment, increase inventories, hire workers, or raise fresh capital. In addition, for firms competing in the global marketplace, international economic indicators are of particular importance, because they allow executives to assess business opportunities abroad.</p> <p>But how do you begin to evaluate these economic reports? There is such a bewildering variety of economic statistics in the public domain that following them all can be harmful to your health. New sets of economic numbers come out every day, week, month, and quarter, and they often tell conflicting stories about what's going on in the U.S. In addition, stocks, bonds, and currencies react differently to economic indicators. Some economic news can cause tremors in the financial markets, while other news produces no reaction at all. Many indicators have no forecasting value whatsoever, yet others have established an impressive track record of being able to predict how the economy will behave during the next 12 months.</p> <p>Moreover, different indicators originate from different sources. The U.S. government pumps out loads of economic data through agencies such as the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Federal Reserve Board. However, numerous private groups also release market-moving indicators. One of the best known is The Conference Board for its Consumer Confidence and Leading Economic Indicators series. In addition, the National Association of Realtors reports monthly data on existing home sales, and Challenger, Gray and Christmas, the outplacement firm, tallies the number of announced corporate layoffs each month. Note that these sources just gauge U.S. economic activity. When you look at the assortment of economic indicators released by other countries, the quantity of information available becomes mind-numbing.</p> <p>Clearly there is too much economic information out there, and not all of it is useful. So what do you focus on? How does an investor, a CEO, or even an economist decide which of the many gauges of business activity are worth tracking? Which indicators pack the greatest wallop in the financial markets? Which ones are known for doing the best job of predicting where the economy is heading? These are the key questions I try to answer in this book.</p> <p>The book is organized in a way that I believe makes the most sense for you. Chapter 1, "The Lock-Up," begins with the drama that typically surrounds the release of a sensitive economic indicator. After the embargo is lifted and the economic report flashes across computer screens around the world, reaction to the latest news by global money markets can affect the financial well-being of every American.</p> <p>One cannot successfully write a book on economic indicators without at least gently introducing a few basic economic terms. In Chapter 2, "A Beginner's Guide: Understanding the Lingo," I try to define as painlessly as possible those key phrases and concepts that are essential to know when reading about economic indicators.</p> <p>The essence of the book begins with Chapter 3, "The Most Influential U.S. Economic Indicators." Here, all the major U.S. economic indicators are evaluated, and each one is discussed in a format designed to answer these vital questions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Why is this indicator important to know?</p> </li> <li> <p>How is it computed? (Sure, not everyone will want to get into the nitty-gritty details of how economic indicators are put together. Nevertheless, by understanding the underlying methodology of how they are calculated, one is better able to appreciate the usefulness of these indicators, as well as their shortcomings.)</p> </li> <li> <p>What does the economic indicator have to say about the future? The purpose of this question is twofold. First you are shown how to interpret the official report and its accompanying tables. Particular emphasis is placed on the most interesting and useful data points in the economic release. Second, guidance is given on how to locate valuable clues in the tables that may offer you a heads-up on how the economy might perform in the months ahead. To make this task easier, copies of actual releases are included with most indicators covered in this book. Virtually all the economic releases mentioned are available on the Internet for free. You can read them on their respective Web sites or download the releases as PDF files. (Note that Internet addresses for the economic indicators are included in this book.)</p> </li> <li> <p>How might bonds, stocks, and the dollar react to the latest economic reports? The financial markets often respond differently to economic data. Much depends on the specific indicator released, how timely it is, whether investors are surprised by the news, and what else is going on in the economy at the time.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Chapter 4, "International Economic Indicators: Why Are They So Important?," examines the most influential foreign economic indicators. Because the U.S. economy and its financial markets are closely integrated with the rest of the world, one can no longer afford to ignore measures of economic activity in other countries. If the economies of other nations are growing, they'll buy more from U.S. producers. On the other hand, poor growth abroad bodes ill for many large U.S. companies and their employees. In addition, American investors interested in buying foreign stocks and bonds for their own portfolios should track foreign economic indicators to identify those countries and regions in the world that might offer the most attractive returns.</p> <p>Chapter 5, "Best Web Sites for U.S. Economic Indicators," is evidence of how much times have changed. Not too long ago, anyone interested in obtaining a set of current and historical economic statistics had to purchase them from a private number-crunching firm. The more stats you wanted, the more costly it was. Today, nearly all this data can be accessed instantly on the Internet for free! The democratization of economic statistics gives everyone, from the experienced professional to the weekend investor, the opportunity to download, read, and analyze economic information. In this chapter, I've assembled what I think are among the best and most authoritative Web sites for economic data. Again, all are free, though some may ask users to register.</p> <p>Chapter 6, "Best Web Sites for International Economic Indicators," is a compilation of Web sites that enables you to quickly locate foreign economic data that might otherwise be tough to find. However, there's one important caveat to keep in mind: No country collects and disseminates as much high-quality economic information as the U.S. Its breadth and integrity make it the gold standard in the world. Although there is a vast amount of international economic data on the Web, one has to approach such sources with caution. There are issues concerning language (many are not in English), comprehensiveness, accuracy, and timeliness. In this chapter, I've listed sites on the Internet that in my judgment are the best and most trustworthy for international economic data&#x2014;and that are available in English! Once again, every site listed is free (at least at the time of this writing).</p> <p>Finally, let me close by saying that this book was fun to write, largely because I learned a great deal in the process. It is not meant to be a textbook or some intellectual treatise on the economy. My purpose throughout is to help give you a better understanding of how to look at economic indicators, why they can be so influential, what they might tell us about the future, and how people can best utilize all that information. If I have accomplished this in some way, than it was worth all the swearing and temper tantrums I went through every time my computer crashed in the course of this endeavor.</p> <br> <p>� Copyright Pearson Education.

He opens with a chapter on Roman military disintegration and the practice of warfare in the barbarian kingdoms erected on the empire's ruins. He then shows how feudalization multiplied conflicts, and describes the resulting growth of the "great stone civilization" of the castle. In the area of military method, he emphasizes three innovations: gunpowder, standing armies and the increased use of infantry, supplying in each case a wealth of data and documentation.</p> <p>Contamine traces the rise of a new literature of strategy and changes in the concept of courage which he puts in the context of actual risk. He points out that the chivalric ideals of the later Middle Ages operated within narrow limits, outside which aristocrats and commoners freely slaughtered each other. Contamine also analyzes the theories of just and unjust war that developed at this time, and illustrates a phenomenon more typical of the period; the religious glorification of the warrior.</p> <p>Ever mindful of the chaos and devastation that war brings, War in the Middle Ages nonetheless offers a clear and consistent picture of the military ethos of a millennium.</p></p><p><p>Philippe Contamine is a French historian of the Middle Ages who specialises in military history and the history of the nobility. Contamine is a past president of the Acad�mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, the Soci�t� de l'histoire de France, and the Societ� des Antiquaires de France.</p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Casting the Runes and Other Ghost Stories (The World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>This selection of twenty-one short stories by M.R.

Although he studied law at Paris, he devoted his life entirely to writing. His most popular stories, besides <i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</i> (1870), include: <i>Five Weeks in a Balloon</i> (1863), <i>Journey to the Center of the Earth</i> (1864), <i>A Trip to the Moon</i> (1865), <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i> (1872), and <i>Michael Strogoff</i> (1876). In addition, he was the author of a number of successful plays, as well as a popular history of exploration from Phoenician times to the mid-nineteenth century, <i>The Discovery of the Earth</i> (1878-80). After a long and active career in literature, Jules Verne died at Amiens, France, in 1905.<br>Isaac Asimov authored over 400 books in a career that lasted nearly 50 years. As a leading scientific writer, historian, and futurist, he covered a variety of subjects ranging from mathematics to humor, and won numerous awards for his work.<b>Chapter 1<br>I</b><br>The Great Storm of 1865.-Shouts in the Air.-A Balloon in a Whirlwind.-The Torn Fabric.-Nothing but Water.-Five Passengers.-The Events in the Gondola.-A Shoreline on the Horizon.-The Outcome of the Drama.<br><br>"Are we rising?"<br><br>"No! Quite the reverse! We're sinking!"<br><br>"Worse than that, Mr. Cyrus! We're falling!"<br><br>"For the love of God! Drop some ballast!"<br><br>"That's the last sack emptied!"<br><br>"Is the balloon climbing now?"<br><br>"No!"<br><br>"I think I hear waves crashing!"<br><br>"We're over the ocean!"<br><br>"We can't be more than five hundred feet above it!"<br><br>Just then a powerful voice rent the air, and the following words rang out:<br><br>"Everything heavy overboard! . . . everything! And God save us!"<br><br>Such were the cries echoing over the vast emptiness of the Pacific Ocean on March 23rd, 1865, at about four o'clock in the afternoon.<br><br>Surely no one will have forgotten the terrible northeasterly gale that was unleashed at the vernal equinox of that year. The barometer fell to 710 millimeters, and the storm went on unabated from the eighteenth to the twenty-sixth of March. Great was the devastation it wrought, in America, Europe, and Asia alike-a vast diagonal swath of destruction eighteen hundred miles wide, from the thirty-fifth parallel north to the fortieth south! Shattered cities, uprooted forests, shorelines ravaged by crashing mountains of water, ships slammed against the shore-by the hundreds, according to the dossiers of the Bureau Veritas-whole regions leveled by cyclones that smashed everything in their path, a human toll that numbered in the thousands, both on land and at sea: such was the scene in the wake of the cyclone, and such were the tokens of its fury. In the ranks of natural disasters, it outstripped even the horrific devastation witnessed at Havana and on the island of Guadeloupe, on October 25th, 1810, and July 26th, 1825, respectively.<br><br>Now, even as these many catastrophes were unfolding at sea and on land, another drama, no less prodigious, was being played out in the turbulent skies.<br><br>For a balloon, wafted along atop a whirlwind like a toy ball, and caught up in the rotational movement of the column of air, was traveling through the heavens at a speed of ninety miles an hour,* spinning in circles as if seized by some aerial maelstrom.<br><br>Beneath the appendix on the underside of the balloon swayed a gondola holding five passengers, scarcely visible in the dense mists and sea spray that suffused the air.<br><br>Whence came this aerostat, this plaything of the terrible storm? From what point on the globe had it taken flight? It could not have set off in the middle of the cyclone, of course, and the cyclone's first symptoms had appeared on the eighteenth-five days before. The reasonable conclusion would thus be that the balloon had come from far, far away; indeed, given the speed of the wind, it could not have traveled less than two thousand miles in every twenty-four-hour period!<br><br>But, caught up in the storm as they were, the passengers had no point of reference, and hence no means of gauging the distance they had traveled. Indeed, a very curious phenomenon must then have been at work: the violent winds propelled them at a terrific speed, and yet they themselves had no sense of their own motion. Forward they sped, ever turning circles, as perfectly unaware of their rotation as of their horizontal movement. Their gaze could not penetrate the thick mass of fog below them; and around them all was gray mist, forming a veil so opaque that they could not say whether it was day or night. No glimmer of light, no sound from land, no ocean roar could have reached them through that vast darkness so long as they remained at high altitude. Their rapid descent alone had alerted them to the peril they faced above the waves.<br><br>But now, relieved of all heavy objects such as ammunition, weapons, and provisions, the balloon had once again risen into the upper levels of the atmosphere, to an altitude of 4,500 feet. Realizing that the sea alone lay beneath the gondola, and believing the dangers awaiting them above to be less formidable than those below, the passengers did not hesitate to jettison even the most vital elements of their equipment; their only thought was to prevent any further loss of the precious gas, the soul of their conveyance, that held them aloft over the abyss.<br><br>The night passed, full of fears that might have proven fatal for less vigorous souls. Then daylight returned, and with the sunrise the storm began to abate. A newfound calm settled over the atmosphere in the first hours of that twenty-fourth of March. By dawn the clouds had grown more billowy, and had lifted higher into the sky. Over the next several hours, the whirlwind gradually expanded and weakened. The winds, once hurricane-force, were now at the "near-gale" level, meaning that the speed of the atmospheric levels' translatory motion had fallen by half. The balloon was still caught up in a wind that would have caused a prudent sailor to take three reefs in his sail; nevertheless, the perturbation of the atmosphere had greatly decreased.<br><br>By eleven o'clock, the air had cleared noticeably at the lower altitudes. The atmosphere was bathed in the sort of damp limpidity that is often seen, and even felt, in the wake of a major meteorological phenomenon. It seemed not so much that the cyclone had moved on to the west as that it had simply exhausted itself. Perhaps, once the center had collapsed, its energy had dispersed in sheets of electricity, as sometimes happens with typhoons in the Indian Ocean.<br><br>At about this same hour, it became evident that the balloon was once again sinking through the lower levels of the atmosphere, slowly and continuously. Worse yet, it seemed to be deflating little by little, the envelope growing longer, distended, no longer spherical but ovoid.<br><br>By noon, the aerostat hovered no more than two thousand feet above the sea. Its volume was fifty thousand cubic feet,* and it was thanks to this that it had stayed so long afloat; for a balloon with such a capacity can travel both high and far.<br><br>Now the passengers jettisoned the last few objects weighing down the gondola, the small remaining store of foodstuffs, even the utensils crammed into their pockets, and one of them, hoisting himself onto the ring that encircled the ropes of the net, tried to tie off the aerostat's appendix with a sturdy knot.<br><br>It was clear that the passengers could not hope to maintain the balloon in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. A great quantity of gas must have escaped from the envelope into the open air!<br><br>They were finished!<br><br>For no continent lay beneath them, not even so much as an island. Not a single landing place as far as the eye could see, not a single solid surface in which to cast anchor.<br><br>Only the vast ocean, whose waves continued to crash with an inconceivable violence! The sea, with no visible end, not even from an altitude that offered a view of forty miles in every direction! Only a liquid plain, relentlessly tossed and whipped by the winds, which appeared from this height as an endless cavalcade of frenzied waves topped by a vast expanse of foaming whitecaps! No land in sight, not a ship to be seen!<br><br>The descent would have to be halted, no matter what the cost, for if left to fall unchecked the balloon would soon vanish into the billows. It was thus to this urgent task that the passengers of the gondola now turned their efforts; but no matter how they struggled, the balloon only continued to sink, all the while moving at great speed with the direction of the wind, from northeast to southwest.<br><br>A truly terrible situation now faced the aerostat's wretched passengers! They were clearly no longer in control of their craft. Their exertions had no effect. The envelope of the balloon was deflating before their eyes; the gas was escaping, and they had not the slightest hope of preserving it. The descent was accelerating perceptibly, and, at one hour past noon, the gondola hung only six hundred feet above the ocean.<br><br>For the leak had proved impossible to stem, and the gas flowed unhindered through a tear in the fabric of the balloon.<br><br>By ridding the gondola of its contents, the passengers had prolonged their aerial suspension by a few hours. The catastrophe could be delayed, but it could not be prevented; and unless some land appeared before nightfall, the passengers, the gondola, and the balloon would disappear forever beneath the waves.<br><br>One final maneuver was left to them, and it was to this that they now turned in desperation. It should be plain to see that the aerostat's passengers were men of great mettle, able to look unflinching into the face of death, without a single murmur of complaint. They were determined to fight to the very last, to do whatever they must to slow their fall. The gondola was nothing more than a sort of wicker basket, incapable of flotation; once it had dropped to the surface of the water, it would inevitably sink like a stone.<br><br>At two o'clock, the aerostat was scarcely four hundred feet above the waves.<br><br>Just then, a manly voice-the voice of one whose heart was impervious to fear-made itself heard. To this voice responded other voices, no less forceful than the first.<br><br>"Has everything been thrown out?"<br><br>"No! There are still ten thousand francs in gold!"<br><br>And at once a heavy sack fell into the water.<br><br>"Is the balloon climbing now?"<br><br>"A little, but it will soon be sinking again!"<br><br>"What's left to throw overboard?"<br><br>"Nothing!"<br><br>"One thing! . . . The gondola!"<br><br>"Hang on to the net! and off with the gondola!"<br><br>For this was their one last means of lightening the aerostat. The ropes attaching the gondola to the ring were cut, and when it had fallen away the aerostat climbed two thousand feet higher.<br><br>The five passengers had clambered into the netting above the ring, and clung to the network of interlaced ropes, staring down at the abyss.<br><br>The static sensitivity of balloons is well known. To jettison even the lightest object is to provoke an immediate vertical displacement, for the apparatus acts like a balance of mathematical precision as it floats in the air. Thus, when it is unburdened of a relatively large weight, its upward movement will naturally be sudden and considerable. Such was the result in this case.<br><br>But after stabilizing in the upper altitudes for a brief moment, the aerostat once again began to sink. The gas still leaked from the rip, and the rip was beyond repair.<br><br>The passengers had done everything within their power. No human intervention could save them now. There was nothing left to do but hope for assistance from God.<br><br>At four o'clock, the balloon was only five hundred feet above the surface of the water.<br><br>A resounding bark was heard. There was a dog with the passengers, clinging to the interlaced ropes alongside its master.<br><br>"Top's seen something!" one of the passengers cried.<br><br>Then, at once, a loud voice rang out:<br><br>"Land! Land!"<br><br>Still carried southwest on the wind, the balloon had traveled some hundreds of miles since dawn, and a slightly elevated coastline now appeared in that direction.<br><br>But that shore was still thirty miles leeward. It would take no less than an hour to reach it, and only on condition that the balloon not be blown off course. They could not say if it was an island or a continent, for they scarcely knew toward what part of the world the cyclone had carried them! In any case, inhabited or not, hospitable or not, that land was their only hope!<br><br>But by four o'clock it was all too evident that the balloon could no longer stay aloft. Even now it was skimming the surface of the sea. Several times already the peaks of the enormous waves had lapped at the bottom of the net, further adding to its weight, and the aerostat only half floated in the air, like a bird with lead shot in its wing.<br><br>A half-hour later, the land lay only a mile distant; but the balloon, exhausted, limp, distended, creased with great folds, had lost all but a small pocket of gas at the top. It could no longer bear the weight of the passengers who clung to its net; soon they were half submerged in the water, and buffeted by the furious waves. The slack sheath of the balloon now acted as a sort of sail, catching the great gusts and speeding over the water like a ship with a tailwind. Perhaps it would be blown to shore!<br><br>It was only two cables from land when four terrible cries burst from four breasts at once. Just when it had begun to seem certain that the balloon would never rise again, a huge wave had washed over it, and it had taken an unexpected leap upward. As if suddenly freed of a part of its burden, it climbed to an altitude of fifteen hundred feet; there it encountered a sort of eddying wind, which, rather than carrying it directly toward the coastline, drove it along almost parallel to the shore. Finally, two minutes later, it obliquely approached the land, and at last came to rest on the sands of the shoreline beyond the reach of the waves.<br><br>Each helping the next, the passengers extricated themselves from the ropes of the net. Freed of their weight, the balloon was caught up by the wind, and, just as an injured bird sometimes briefly comes back to life, it disappeared into the heavens.<br><br>Five men and a dog had once occupied the balloon's gondola, but only four were thrown onto this beach.<br><br>The one missing had evidently been carried off by the great wave that had struck the net. Relieved of his weight, the aerostat had made one final climb, only to fall to earth a few moments later.<br><br>And as these castaways-for such indeed they were-set foot on land, their thoughts turned at once to the missing member of their party. As one man, they cried:<br><br>"He might be trying to swim ashore! We've got to rescue him! rescue him!"</p><h2>A Workbook for Arguments, Second Edition: A Complete Course in Critical Thinking</h2><p><i>A Workbook for Arguments </i>builds on Anthony Weston&#x2019;s <i>A Rulebook for Arguments</i> to provide a complete textbook for a course in critical thinking or informal logic.

He lays out the cultural background, explains symbolism and Old Testament connections, and fleshes out the details of each story. Each chapter also includes a section focused on how the miracle relates to the life of the modern follower of Jesus. Kistemaker&#39;s scholarly attention to detail coupled with accessible explanations and application will make this book valuable to everyone from lay readers to pastors looking for sermon material.</p><p>Rediscover the mystery. We&#39;ve heard the stories about Jesus calming the storm, feeding the five thousand, and healing the blind. But they can seem so far removed from our experience of following Jesus today. What would it have been like to witness these events firsthand? Simon Kistemaker helps you take a closer look at the miracles of Jesus to better understand the purpose behind each one. By carefully laying out cultural background, symbolism, and Old Testament connections, Kistemaker shows you how these miracles relate to the way you follow Jesus. The result is a detailed exploration that will deepen your understanding of Jesus&#39;s miraculous works. &#34;I love the clear, simple, yet profoundly insightful way Simon Kistemaker explores the miracles of Jesus.

In the process, they were intervening in the world's natural environment in equally unprecedented and dramatic ways. A sweeping work of environmental history, <i>The Unending Frontier </i>offers a truly global perspective on the profound impact of humanity on the natural world in the early modern period. <br><br>John F. Richards identifies four broadly shared historical processes that speeded environmental change from roughly 1500 to 1800 c.e.: intensified human land use along settlement frontiers; biological invasions; commercial hunting of wildlife; and problems of energy scarcity. <i>The Unending Frontier </i>considers each of these trends in a series of case studies, sometimes of a particular place, such as Tokugawa Japan and early modern England and China, sometimes of a particular activity, such as the fur trade in North America and Russia, cod fishing in the North Atlantic, and whaling in the Arctic. Throughout, Richards shows how humans&#x2015;whether clearing forests or draining wetlands, transporting bacteria, insects, and livestock; hunting species to extinction, or reshaping landscapes&#x2015;altered the material well-being of the natural world along with their own.</p><p>"<i>The Unending Frontier</i> brings into focus the staggering environmental changes that came with the creation of the early modern world economy. John Richards assembles material from all around the world into a crisp and coherent picture of the meaning of global markets for the biosphere in the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries. This is a work of the first importance for environmental history, for economic history, and for world history."&#x2015;John R. McNeill, author of <i>Something New under the Sun: An Environmental History of the Twentieth-Century World</i><br><br>"A landmark book. Richards moves deftly among various ways of thinking about the early modern environment&#x2015;national case studies, studies of particular industries, and reflections on increasing global interconnections&#x2015;so that we get not only a wealth of important data and stories, but multiple perspectives on the topic as a whole. Both the breadth and the depth of the project are inspiring: people will learn new things about environmental change, even in their regions of specialization. But the biggest payoff is in the way Richards weaves environmental change into more familiar early modern stories of global trade, colonialism, technological change, and, above all, state formation. None of these topics will ever look quite the same again."&#x2015;Kenneth Pomeranz, author of <i>The Great Divergence: Europe, China, and the Making of the Modern World Economy</i><b>John F.

Their extensive work accomplishes so much by shifting the perspective of political scientists. The Macro Polity will undoubtedly affect the research agenda of many scholars for years to come. It will be an early entry on any list of 'The Classics' in political science."

Drawn from the personal experiences of a therapist and practitioner of Vipassana meditation, this work explores meditation&#x2019;s similarities and differences with psychotherapeutic and scientific endeavors. In the title essay, parallels are drawn between the atomic synthesis of free choice and lawful consequence in Chaos Theory and karma, offering contemporary insights into one of Buddhism&#x2019;s core concepts. The empirical roots of meditation, its relevance to daily life, and the challenges and benefits of daily practice of Vipassana meditation are also addressed. Practical examples for continued observation outside of formal meditation retreats guide readers in incorporating Buddhist practice into daily life.<br></p><p><b>Paul R.

Against impossible odds, it is their courage alone that will decide the course of the war...</p><p>Jack Higgins lives on Jersey in the Channel Islands.An old-fashioned framing device kicks off this rerelease: The author and his wife survive a rough plane ride on a stormy night. While recovering in a small inn, they hear a WWII yarn -- the tale of twin American brothers who fought for opposite sides in the war and the plan concocted by desperate Germans to take advantage of their resemblance. The switching of twins is a classic theme, but the skills of both author Jack Higgins and narrator Patrick Macnee keep the tale fresh and entertaining. Higgins's skill in recreating the war era makes this one worth catching up on. J.A.S. � AudioFile 2002, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Last of the Tsars: Nicholas II and the Russia Revolution</h2><p><p><strong>A riveting account of the last eighteen months of Tsar Nicholas II's life and reign from one of the finest Russian historians writing today.</strong></p> In March 1917, Nicholas II, the last Tsar of All the Russias, abdicated and the dynasty that had ruled an empire for three hundred years was forced from power by revolution. Now, on the hundredth anniversary of that revolution, Robert Service, the eminent historian of Russia, examines Nicholas's life and thought from the months before his momentous abdication to his death, with his family, in Ekaterinburg in July 1918.<br> The story has been told many times, but Service's deep understanding of the period and his forensic examination of previously untapped sources, including the Tsar's diaries and recorded conversations, as well as the testimonies of the official inquiry, shed remarkable new light on his troubled reign, also revealing the kind of Russia that Nicholas wanted to emerge from the Great War.<br><em>The Last of the Tsars</em> is a masterful study of a man who was almost entirely out of his depth, perhaps even willfully so. It is also a compelling account of the social, economic and political ferment in Russia that followed the February Revolution, the Bolshevik seizure of power in October 1917 and the beginnings of Lenin's Soviet socialist republic. 16 pages of photographs</p><p>Robert Service is the author of twelve books, including The End of the Cold War;&nbsp;Spies and Commissars; the acclaimed&nbsp;Lenin: A Biography;&nbsp;Stalin: A Biography; and&nbsp;Comrades: A History of World Communism. He is currently a professor of Russian history at the University of Oxford, a Fellow of St. Antony's College, Oxford, and a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.&#x201c;Service brings forensic detail to his account of the Romanov family&#x2019;s confinement and murder, mining newly available material that gives the story a you-are-there quality.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A scholarly biography that goes beyond the gruesome depictions of the Romanovs&#x2019; end to examine the more complicated nature of Nicholas II&#x2019;s character. A compelling work; organized, concise, and chilling.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Service&#x2019;s books are authoritative, definitive, and tell a compelling story, and this is no exception. Thanks to Service&#x2019;s exhaustive and persuasive retelling, we can now separate myth and legend from the historical record.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Christian Science Monitor</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Service, a prominent historian who has written the biographies <em>Lenin</em> and <em>Stalin</em>, now tackles Nicholas II. Service uses new evidence well, and it is clear why the Romanov dynasty came to a crushing end.&#x201d;</p><h2>Georgics (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Virgil's affectionate poem of the land brings us the disappointments as well as the rewards of the countryman's year-round devotion to his crops, his vines and olives, livestock great and small, and the complex society of his bees. Part agricultural manual, part political poem and allegory, <em>The Georgics'</em> scenes are real and vivid, allowing the reader to feel the sights, sounds, and textures of the ancient Italian landscape.<br> This lauded new translation has been written by Peter Fallon, who, as a farmer and a poet, is uniquely suited to the task. It is coupled here with an introduction and notes by the classical scholar Elaine Fantham. Fantham's introduction considers Virgil's life and poetry in its historical context, while her notes gloss the many classical and mythological allusions. The combination of a faithful and lyrical translation with well-researched contextual information makes this edition the best possible introduction to Virgil's masterpiece. It is sure to delight all lovers of poetry and Renaissance literature.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

An American History</em> is a concise, clear, and inclusive narrative of American history written by distinguished historian Eric Foner.</strong></p> With characteristic clarity, Professor Foner has written an accessible, event-based narrative that is enriched throughout by the theme of American freedom. Foner shows students how the meanings of freedom have changed during the course of American history and how the limits of freedom have expanded and contracted in response to social, political, cultural, and economic events. The freedom theme integrates the text and motivates the study of history by alerting students to how much is at stake in understanding America&#x2019;s past.<br><br> The first edition of <em>Give Me Liberty!</em> is available as a compact, low-cost paperback.

An instructor at the Scottsdale Artist's School, Arnett, using the medium of oil, combines flowers with other elements of classical still life painting. The results are truly sumptuous. In seven lessons she demonstrates the soft petals and strong colors of magnolias, African tulips, and cascading roses in combination with lush peaches, pears, and figs. Here's a fine book for advanced students. By contrast, Beck uses acrylics and a purely decorative approach. The book is misnamed, for the flowers aren't rendered realistically but in the formal style decorative artists use for ornamenting plates and baskets. This is a fun and approachable volume for beginning and mid-level craft painters. Riley, teaching a freestyle method in watercolors, offers the finest of the three books. In an extremely well-laid-out manual, Riley provides a kind of master class that teaches as much about how to observe flowers as how to paint them. He covers past masters of the genre, as well as non-Western perspectives. The technical sections on lighting flowers, resist painting, and two-color brushwork are beautifully done. If only one of these three excellent volumes can be purchased, make it Riley's.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Truth about Worldviews: A biblical understanding of worldview alternatives</h2><p>In a world where multiple &#34;truths&#34; abound, Christians need to be on their guard to avoid being deceived by other ways of looking at the world that directly oppose Christ and His Word. To be prepared, they must be well informed of these other worldviews and how they differ from Christianity. In this Biblical Essentials study, Dr. Eckman analyzes the main world religions, cults, and philosophical systems as worldviews. He asserts that genuine, biblical Christianity is the only worldview that answers every question relating to spirituality, morality, and the meaning of life. James P.

Albert O. Hirschman was a master essayist, one who possessed the rare ability to blend the precision of economics with the elegance of literary imagination. In an age in which our academic disciplines require ever-greater specialization and narrowness, it is rare to encounter an intellectual who can transform how we think about inequality by writing about traffic, or who can slip in a quote from Flaubert to reveal something surprising about taxes. The essays gathered here span an astonishing range of topics and perspectives, including industrialization in Latin America, imagining reform as more than repair, the relationship between imagination and leadership, routine thinking and the marketplace, and the ways our arguments affect democratic life. Throughout, we find humor, unforgettable metaphors, brilliant analysis, and elegance of style that give Hirschman such a singular voice.</p><p>Featuring an introduction by Jeremy Adelman that places each of these essays in context as well as an insightful afterword by Emma Rothschild and Amartya Sen, <i>The Essential Hirschman</i> is the ideal introduction to Hirschman for a new generation of readers and a must-have collection for anyone seeking his most important writings in one book.</p></p><p><p>"A survivor of Nazi Germany, Albert Hirschman was an essential thinker--one of the very few best of the twentieth century. Wise, delightful, and full of life, he was incapable of writing a dull page. He knew what made people tick, and he knew what made societies work.

Wade</i> legalized abortion&#x2013;but the debate was far from over, continuing to be a political battleground to this day. In the decades since the case was decided, the American debate on abortion has moved away from the issues that the justices confronted more than three decades ago. Bringing to light key voices that illuminate the case and its cultural context, <i>Before Roe v. Wade</i> looks back and recaptures how the arguments for and against abortion took shape as claims about the meaning of the Constitution&#x2014;and about how the nation could best honor its commitment to dignity, liberty, equality, and life. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this ground-breaking book, Linda Greenhouse, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who covered the Supreme Court for 30 years for <i>The New York Times</i>, and Reva Siegel, a renowned professor and former deputy dean at Yale Law School, collect the most significant historical, cultural, and legal documents which helped shape the Supreme Court&#x2019;s controversial decision.</p></p><p><b>Linda Greenhouse</b> began covering the Supreme Court for The New York Times in 1978. With the exception of two years during the mid-1980's, during which she covered Congress, she served as the paper's regular Supreme Court correspondent until 2008. Previously, she covered local and state government and politics for the Times in New York, and was chief of the newspaper's legislative bureau in Albany. She has appeared as a Washington Week panelist since 1980. <p>She is a graduate of Radcliffe College, where she currently serves on the advisory committee to the Schlesinger Library on the History of American Women. She earned a Master of Studies in Law degree from Yale Law School, and has several honorary degrees. </p><p>For her coverage of the Court, she was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in Journalism (beat reporting) in 1998. In 2004, she received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and the John Chancellor Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p><b>Reva Siegel</b> is the Nicholas deB.

Circuit, and began teaching at the University of California at Berkeley. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and is active in the American Society for Legal History, the American Association of Law Schools, the American Constitution Society, in the national organization and as faculty advisor of Yale&#x2019;s chapter.</p>During the 1960s, "a conversation about the legitimate grounds for abortion" turned into "an argument about the legitimacy of government control over abortion," while support for decriminalizing the procedure continued to increase. The Pulitzer-Prize winning Greenhouse (Becoming Justice Blackmun) has covered the Supreme Court for nearly 30 years; together with Yale Law professor Siegel (Processes of Constitutional Decision Making) she has compiled a compelling review of the societal changes, incidents, and cases that led to the Supreme Court's historic decision. Readers today will likely be shocked by the conditions that women experienced before 1973: trips to Japan for abortions; the need to lie at every step; even the possibility of forced sterilization. The authors provide commentary and context on an impressive collection of documents, moving chronologically through every stage of abortion reform to create a compilation that will engage anyone with an interest in women's rights or judicial history. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Building on the procedures reviewers call &#34;powerful tools&#34;, &#34;empirically sound and clinically sophisticated&#34;, and &#34;of great value to professionals who work with children&#34;, the authors have expanded the program that they designed and developed in a number of ways. These include: adaptations that expand its use to a wider range of problems, including impulsive behavior both with and without ADHD, Conduct Disorder, and learning disabilities; greater utilization of hands-on workbook materials; systematic involvement of parents and teachers; application to a broader variety of settings - from the clinician&#39;s office to work with groups, families, and within schools; and more detailed descriptions of treatment strategies, clearly illustrated with case examples and transcripts. Revising and updating the acclaimed original work, and presenting the most detailed account to date of how to implement the authors&#39; carefully wrought procedures, this second edition is an invaluable resource for anyone working with children who need to learn how to &#34;stop and think&#34; before they act. Readers will find this book a rich model of how psychologists develop clinically sensitive and empirically sound approaches to a problem.

Regardless of her response, she needs to know that she can and will make it through this difficult time. And she needs to know that--no matter how it feels--she is not alone. <br><br>More than two decades ago, author Lois Mowday Rabey experienced firsthand the confusion and devastation that follows a husband's death. When Your Soul Aches is an intimate collection of inspiration and insights born of that journey through grief. Every woman who has been rocked by the loss of her partner will find relief in Rabey's vulnerable and touching account of her real-life experiences and those of dozens of other widows. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Every widow's pain is unique. So are her circumstances and her experience. Yet she shares many questions and concerns with other women who have lost their husbands--ones that may be best addressed with the help of those who have previously walked through the fire. <br><br>Such is the help found in the pages of When Your Soul Aches. Written by a widow who remained single for ten years while raising her two daughters, it offers invaluable guidance to women facing the painful emotions and difficult challenges of widowhood. <br><br>Compassionate, empathetic, and wise, this book gently encourages those grieving the loss of their husbands to be honest about their feelings. At the same time, it offers real hope that life, though forever changed, can be sweet and good once again.</p><p>Lois Mowday Rabey has been writing and speaking for over fifteen years on a wide range of topics. When Your Soul Aches, her sixth book, draws from the wisdom she obtained after losing her first husband when she was 34 years old. Lois is married to writer Steve Rabey and has two married daughters and four grandchildren.

So is the belief that education offers a ticket to a better life. But with student-loan debt surpassing the $1 trillion mark and unemployment on the rise, people are beginning to question that value. Is a college diploma still worth pursuing at <i>any price?</i> </p><p>In <i>College (Un)bound</i>, Jeffrey J. Selingo, editor at large for <i>The Chronicle for Higher Education</i>, argues that America&#x2019;s higher education system is broken.

Free massive online open courses (MOOCs) and hybrid classes, adaptive learning software, and the unbundling of traditional degree credits will increase access to high quality education regardless of budget or location and tailor lesson plans to individual needs.

It&#x2019;s the type of American bedroom community where the college-educated settle, start families, watch their children grow up on the town ball fields, and then send them off to college after graduation from Bernards High School.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a rich selection of Advanced Placement courses and the exclusive two-year International Baccalaureate curriculum, the 750-student high school is often ranked among the best public schools in the state. In the fall of 2005, Samantha Dietz entered her senior year at Bernards. She was a member of the debate club, Harvard Model Congress, and worked for the student newspaper. She took Advanced Placement psychology, as well as several International Baccalaureate courses, including English, French, and environmental science. She maintained a 3.9 grade-point average. And like almost all of her senior class, she was bound for college the following fall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dietz would be the first in her family to go to college. Her parents had solid jobs in technology, despite having only high-school diplomas. They didn&#x2019;t push her to go to college, but Dietz&#x2019;s teachers and guidance counselors did, especially to four-year colleges. She applied to more than a half a dozen schools: Rutgers University, Drew University, Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey; Hofstra University in New York; and Allegheny College and Bucknell University in Pennsylvania. She was accepted to all but Bucknell, where she was put on the wait list.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When decision time came in the spring, Dietz closely examined the financial-aid offers from each of the colleges. For her, the choice would be strictly about the bottom line. Fairleigh Dickinson offered her the most financial aid, nearly all of it in grants that wouldn&#x2019;t have to be paid back. Its campus was about twenty minutes away, so she could live at home and save on room and board. With Fairleigh Dickinson&#x2019;s financial package, Dietz&#x2019;s tuition bill would be about half of the university&#x2019;s $25,000 list price at the time. Her decision was easy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Dietz failed to examine was Fairleigh Dickinson&#x2019;s graduation rate. In 2006, only 38 percent of its students graduated within six years, a rate well below all of the other schools she had considered. The two other local schools on her list, Rutgers and Drew, graduated more than 70 percent of their students within six years. Though Fairleigh Dickinson was giving Dietz a boatload of money, her chances of emerging at the other end with a degree were pretty dismal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dietz took a full slate of classes her first semester. To pay tuition, she waitressed and helped manage a restaurant near her house. She worked twenty-five hours a week, mostly on nights and weekends. &#x201c;By Thanksgiving, I was exhausted. I had no down time,&#x201d; she recalls. She was doing well in school, with mostly Bs in her classes. &#x201c;I felt like I was killing myself for nothing,&#x201d; Dietz says. &#x201c;This was money I could be saving and starting my life. I was managing a restaurant, handling finances and employees. I was learning a lot less about the real world in school and paying so much for it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the end of the semester, she received a letter from the university announcing that state funds to private colleges in New Jersey were at risk of being cut. It was a warning: she would likely need to pay even more the following fall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she dropped out of college. <br>The Dropout Crisis <br>The story of Samantha Dietz is not unique. It reflects a broad, national trend in American higher education, where some 400,000 students drop out every year.1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most of the twentieth century, the United States bragged that it had the best colleges and universities in the world &#x2014; and rightfully so. Since the end of World War II, when colleges and universities threw open their doors to returning GIs, helping to create a vast middle class that defined a generation, these institutions have been the envy of the world and a symbol of American greatness. They attracted the most talented students from other countries, and graduated young Americans who were the best educated in the world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not anymore. Over the last thirty years &#x2014; and particularly in the first decade of the new millennium &#x2014; American higher education has lost its way. At the very top, the most elite and prestigious institutions remain the best &#x2014; the world still clamors to get into Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Berkeley, Stanford, Amherst, Williams, and a few dozen other household brands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the colleges and universities attended by most American students, costs are spiraling out of control and quality is declining just as increasing international competition demands that higher education be more productive and less expensive. Only slightly more than 50 percent of American students who enter college leave with a bachelor&#x2019;s degree. Among wealthy countries, only Italy ranks lower. As a result, the United States is now ranked number twelve among developed nations in higher-education attainment by its young people.2 As the baby boomer generation leaves the work force, the country risks having successive generations less educated than the ones that preceded them for the first time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such trends carry significant economic risks for the United States. For every dollar earned by college graduates, those who drop out without a degree earn sixty-seven cents. Since the turn of the century, average wages for high-school graduates &#x2014; who today make up about half of the adult population &#x2014; have fallen considerably to just over $19,000, below the federal poverty level for a family of four. Nothing short of winning the lottery helps ensure a young person will achieve the American dream quite like a college degree. A four-year college credential is the best ticket &#x2014; and perhaps the only ticket &#x2014; for kids from the poorest families to get ahead. For children from families at higher income levels (defined as $61,000 and above), a degree helps them make it to the top themselves. &nbsp; In 2010, four years after Dietz quit Fairleigh Dickinson, she signed up for a class at nearby Raritan Valley Community College. Since then, she has taken one class a semester, paying about $500 a course. She wishes her counselors in high school had encouraged her to consider community college, instead of mocking two-year institutions as places for students who couldn&#x2019;t hack it on a four-year campus.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Dietz is twenty-four years old and working for a real estate company. Her job doesn&#x2019;t require a degree, but she thinks she&#x2019;ll eventually get one. She has heard the statistics on the long-term payoff of a degree, but for the moment Dietz feels she is better off than many of her high-school friends who went to college. &#x201c;They graduated and are in worse situations,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;They are back to waitressing or nannying, not doing anything with their degree. They are living at home and in tons of debt. I&#x2019;m in a much better situation.&#x201d; <br><b>A Risk-Averse, Self-Satisfied Industry</b> <br>American higher education is broken.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like another American icon &#x2014; the auto industry in Detroit &#x2014; the higher-education industry is beset by hubris, opposition to change, and resistance to accountability. Even the leaders of colleges and universities think we&#x2019;re in trouble. More than one-third of them say American higher education is headed in the wrong direction.3<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, in its final report from a year-long study, a federal commission studying the future of higher education warned of the dangers of complacency. &#x201c;What we have learned over the last year makes clear that American higher education has become what, in the business world, would be called a mature enterprise: increasingly risk-averse, at times self-satisfied, and unduly expensive,&#x201d; it said. &#x201c;History is littered with examples of industries that, at their peril, failed to respond to &#x2014; or even to notice &#x2014; changes in the world around them, from railroads to steel manufacturers.&#x201d;4<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change comes very slowly to higher education. Many institutions in the United States were established over two centuries ago, with a handful dating back to the days before the American Revolution. Tradition is important at these colleges. A confluence of events &#x2014; flagging state support for public colleges, huge federal budget deficits, and falling household income &#x2014; now makes it necessary to consider new approaches.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideas for change are everywhere. Almost every day a report about innovation in higher education or an invitation to a meeting about its future lands on my desk. In April 2012, I made my way to one of the largest of those gatherings, the Education Innovation Summit at Arizona State University.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summit was notable for who wasn&#x2019;t there. As I scanned the name tags of the 800 or so attendees, I found very few were actual educators &#x2014; the college presidents, professors, or others who spend their days on campuses immersed in the business of higher education.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gathering at an office park for start-ups run by Arizona State had attracted educational entrepreneurs, CEOs, and investors to hear talks about the future of education and see demonstrations from more than a hundred companies promising to bring massive change to the tradition-bound industry.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kicking off the meeting with a call to arms was Michael Crow, the hard-charging leader who, in his ten years as president, had transformed Arizona State from a sleepy public university to a test bed for new ideas. Lecturing the group on what ails higher education, he summed up its problems in a word most of us had never heard &#x2014; filiopietism. Translation: higher education is clinging to tradition. Too few students are going to college, not enough are graduating, and the whole thing costs too much. Quoting his father, a US Navy sailor, Crow called this a &#x201c;piss-poor performance.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Crow is derided in some academic circles for his business-like approach to higher education, he found a sympathetic audience in this gathering. For this crowd, lacking an academic pedigree is exactly what&#x2019;s needed to reform the outdated methods of traditional colleges, and of course, profit at the same time. Investors are lining up to cash in on the college of tomorrow. Venture capitalists poured some $429 million into education companies in 2011. That same year, in the midst of a worldwide economic slump, 124 education start-ups received financial backing, the most since 1999 during the height of the dot-com boom.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new business ideas that are changing higher education range from rethinking how high-school students apply to college (think Facebook, with colleges making friend requests to prospective applicants), to how courses are delivered (150,000 students in an online class), to how learners are certified (think of a badge like those given in the Boy Scouts, instead of a diploma). Each new idea raises the anxiety level of administrators on traditional college campuses that have had a monopoly on the credential market and want to maintain it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other industries, &#x201c;those who don&#x2019;t innovate go out of business,&#x201d; Jennifer Fremont-Smith tells me under the ninety-degree Scottsdale sun during a break in the program. She is cofounder of Smarterer, a Boston-based start-up that offers technology for validating technical skills on everything from social media to Microsoft Office programs. &#x201c;Higher ed,&#x201d; she adds, &#x201c;shouldn&#x2019;t be different.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the technological advances of the past two decades, the revolution in the way college education is delivered is just beginning. For the most part, the residential college experience of today is much like it was ten or twenty years ago &#x2014; the classrooms, dorms, dining halls, and quad. Though laptops and iPads are ubiquitous in lecture halls, students can take classes online, the dining halls have sushi, and nearly everyone has a smartphone, the basics of going to college and getting a broad education or training in a profession remain largely unchanged.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least for now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A college has many purposes, from research and discovery to maturing students. At its core, one of the purposes is information delivery, and in recent years other long-established content providers from music to journalism to books have been transformed by technology, resulting in the decline of the middleman &#x2014; record stores, newspapers, bookstores, and publishers. Are colleges next? Talk of a coming disruption to the traditional college model has reached a fever pitch in some corners of higher education &#x2014; each day seems to bring news of innovations with the potential to transform how we get a college degree, just as iTunes forever changed how we buy music.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If every revolution has a turning point, perhaps that defining moment came for higher education in the fall of 2011. A Stanford professor, Sebastian Thrun, and Google&#x2019;s Director of Research, Peter Norvig, offered their graduate-level artificial intelligence course online for free. They thought the class might appeal to 500 students, perhaps a thousand. It ended up attracting 160,000 students from 190 countries, prompting the label &#x201c;Massive Online Open Course,&#x201d; or MOOC. The 22,000 students who finished received an official &#x201c;Statement of Accomplishment.&#x201d; Thrun then asked the top thousand students who had perfect or near-perfect scores on their assignments to send him their r�sum�s. He promised to pass the best ones on to tech companies throughout Silicon Valley. After the course ended, Thrun turned his focus to a company he started, Udacity, which offers low-cost, online classes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the Stanford class touched off a string of announcements in the following months by MIT, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Michigan, Princeton University, and dozens of others that they would attempt to deliver a piece of their brand-name education to the masses online. At the same time, new ideas to substantially lower the cost of a traditional college degree were emerging. The most notable effort was at the University of North Texas. There leaders called in the management consulting firm, Bain &amp; Company, famous for helping corporate America restructure its operations, to assist the university in designing the college of the future for its branch campus in Dallas. The model shaped by Bain called for a limited number of majors tied to the needs of the local economy (such as business and information technology), classes offered year-round, and hybrid courses (a combination of online and face-to-face classes). For students who graduate on time, a bachelor&#x2019;s degree would cost about $18,000.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new University of North Texas campus and massive online courses like Thrun&#x2019;s are precisely the type of disruptive forces that Clay Christensen envisions displacing traditional players i...</p><h2>Signals and Systems, 2005 Interactive Solutions Edition</h2><p>Design and MATLAB concepts have been integrated in text.<br> * Integrates applications as it relates signals to a remote sensing system, a controls system, radio astronomy, a biomedical system and seismology.</p><p></p><h2>Beloved</h2><p>(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed) <br>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, Toni Morrison's "Beloved" is a spellbinding and dazzlingly innovative portrait of a woman haunted by the past. <br>Sethe was born a slave and escaped to Ohio, but eighteen years later she is still not free. She has borne the unthinkable and not gone mad, yet she is still held captive by memories of Sweet Home, the beautiful farm where so many hideous things happened. Meanwhile Sethe's house has long been troubled by the angry, destructive ghost of her baby, who died nameless and whose tombstone is engraved with a single word: "Beloved." <br>Sethe works at beating back the past, but it makes itself heard and felt incessantly in her memory and in the lives of those around her. When a mysterious teenage girl arrives, calling herself Beloved, Sethe's terrible secret explodes into the present. <br>Combining the visionary power of legend with the unassailable truth of history, Morrison's unforgettable novel is one of the great and enduring works of American literature.</p><p>As with the ghost at its center, <i>Beloved</i> has taken many forms--from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel to Oprah Winfrey's decade-in-the-making movie to this challenging audiobook read by Lynn Whitfield. Whitfield, who won an Emmy Award playing the title role in <i>The Josephine Baker Story</i>, has a tough assignment as she guides us back and forth in time with Sethe, an escaped slave who's still shackled by memories of her murdered child. But, as we shift between Sethe's brutal plantation days and her haunted life immediately after the Civil War, we learn one secret after another until, finally, past and present are masterfully reconciled. (Running time: three hours, two cassettes) <i>--Kimberly Heinrichs</i>Toni Morrison--author of Song of Solomon and Tar Baby--is a writer of remarkable powers: her novels, brilliantly acclaimed for their passion, their dazzling language and their lyric and emotional force, combine the unassailable truths of experience and emotion with the vision of legend and imagination. <br>It is the story--set in post-Civil War Ohio--of Sethe, an escaped slave who has risked death in order to wrench herself from a living death; who has lost a husband and buried a child; who has borne the unthinkable and not gone mad: a woman of "iron eyes and backbone to match." Sethe lives in a small house on the edge of town with her daughter, Denver, her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, and a disturbing, mesmerizing intruder who calls herself Beloved. <br>Sethe works at "beating back the past," but it is alive in all of them. It keeps Denver fearful of straying from the house. It fuels the sadness that has settled into Baby Suggs' "desolated center where the self that was no self made its home." And to Sethe, the past makes itself heard and felt incessantly: in memories that both haunt and soothe her...in the arrival of Paul D ("There was something blessed in his manner. Women saw him and wanted to weep"), one of her fellow slaves on the farm where she had once been kept...in the vivid and painfully cathartic stories she and Paul D tell each other of their years in captivity, of their glimpses of freedom...and, most powerfully, in the apparition of Beloved, whose eyes are expressionless at their deepest point, whose doomed childhood belongs to the hideous logic of slavery and who, as daughter, sister and seductress, has now come from the "place over there" to claim retribution for what shelost and for what was taken from her. <br>Sethe's struggle to keep Beloved from gaining full possession of her present--and to throw off the long, dark legacy of her past--is at the center of this profoundly affecting and startling novel. But its intensity and resonance of feeling, and the boldness of its narrative, lift it beyond its particulars so that it speaks to our experience as an entire nation with a past of both abominable and ennobling circumstance. <br>In Beloved, Toni Morrison has given us a great American novel. <br>Toni Morrison was awarded the 1988 Pulitzer Prize in Literature for Beloved.</p><h2>The New Leader&#39;s 100-Day Action Plan: How to Take Charge, Build or Merge Your Team, and Get Immediate Results</h2><p><p><b>Entering a new leadership role?

Born in Zacatecas, Mexico, in the mid-sixteenth century, Don Juan was the prominent son of an aristocratic silver-mining family.</p> <p>In 1598, in his late forties, O�ate led a formidable expedition of settlers, with wagons and livestock, on an epic march northward to the upper Rio Grade Valley of New Mexico. There he established the first European settlement west of the Mississippi, launching a significant chapter in early American history.</p> <p>In his activities he displayed qualities typical of Spain&#x2019;s sixteenth-century men of action; in his career we find a summation of the motives, aspirations, intentions, strengths, and weaknesses of the Hispanic pioneers who settled the Borderlands.</p></p><p><p>Historian <b>Marc Simmons</b> is a founder and the first president of the Santa Fe Trail Association. His forty-nine books include six about the Trail and <i>The Last Conquistador: Juan de O�ate and the Settling of the Far Southwest</i>.</p>The history of hostile relations between New Mexico's Native Americans and their Hispanic conquerors is the subtext to this biography of the life of Onate, a Mexican of Basque descent who spent the years 1598 to 1607 exploring the Southwest from his colonial base in San Gabriel, just north of today's Santa Fe. Though he and his colonists owed their survival to the food and shelter provided by the Pueblo Indians, they were unable to coexist with other tribes, slaughtering many Native Americans. Onate achieved neither his goal of finding silver mines nor of gaining Christian converts. He ultimately left in disgrace. Historian Simmons rarely questions Onate's assumptions that the Native Americans owed him their land and their lives. His is a straightforward historical narrative occasionally relieved by insights into the Spanish character. No other recent or easily accessible biographies exist for this controversial figure, still known in some circles as the Father of New Mexico.
